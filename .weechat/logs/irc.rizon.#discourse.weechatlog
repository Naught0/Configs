2016-10-17 19:35:33	@JX7P	the elevation of genuinely meaningless terms like 'authenticity' or 'genuineness' is just sophistry if you ask me

2016-10-17 19:41:02	%naughtsee	ajimu: his novels are a treat
2016-10-17 19:41:07	@quinn	naughtsee: ok ask me a word
2016-10-17 19:41:09	%naughtsee	they're so cynical and hilarious
2016-10-17 19:41:11	@JX7P	in the end i'm really firmly entrenched in materialised hegelianism (or, as Marx called it, its reformation starting from only its rational kernel) and i just like to look at the poststructuralists and other continentals because sometimes they come up with interesting ideas. some of the analytics are less awful than others but >positivism
2016-10-17 19:41:13	@kori	naughtsee: oooo, sartre?
2016-10-17 19:41:18	@ajimu	I think I missed the window for my angsty early 20s phase

2016-10-17 19:41:41	@kori	ajimu: since u know le edgy terms what would you describe my philosophy as
2016-10-17 19:41:43	@JX7P	phenomenology of spirit
2016-10-17 19:41:47	@quinn	dam

2016-10-17 19:43:00	@JX7P	i find heidegger and his ilk particularly offputting: some examples of heidegger's thought https://scontent-lhr3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14370067_1723838371211959_2565479968101198138_n.jpg?oh=b9fc346fbd79665717fd5a65ccb646de&oe=58A3F682

2016-10-17 19:43:28	@ajimu	idk really, it's been a while since I heard more than that you're trying to deconstruct stuff
2016-10-17 19:43:43	@kori	its been a while since ive written anything
2016-10-17 19:43:50	%naughtsee	Also philosophy doesn't have to be pretentious guys
2016-10-17 19:43:58	@JX7P	naughtsee, freshly back in
2016-10-17 19:44:01	%naughtsee	I think it's important that it can be put in lay terms

2016-10-17 19:44:16	@kori	:^)
2016-10-17 19:44:21	@kori	maybe naughtsee can give some pointerz
2016-10-17 19:44:23	@quinn	ajimu: aka u dont wanna pay for college?
2016-10-17 19:44:35	@JX7P	i completed study of psychology with the pretigious Open University some time ago, got a dream job at the pharmacy, got made redundant when the co-operative sold it to a private enterprise
2016-10-17 19:44:47	@ajimu	I don't want to pay for college but I made that decision when I was a teenager
2016-10-17 19:45:09	@ajimu	what I meant was I don't buy the "this is how things are and being a socialist is silly and naive" thing
2016-10-17 19:45:15	@quinn	naughtsee: this is like saying that all CS classes and discussions should be readily intelligible to normies
2016-10-17 19:45:15	@JX7P	i have the advantage of living in free study land
2016-10-17 19:45:22	%naughtsee	JX7P: that's sick 
2016-10-17 19:45:29	%naughtsee	quinn: completely false
2016-10-17 19:45:36	%naughtsee	philosophy is simple
2016-10-17 19:45:48	@quinn	just like the soul?
2016-10-17 19:45:49	@JX7P	also £7500/year in grant and student loan (which you needn't pay back till you earn over £21k a year) for living expenses etc
2016-10-17 19:45:51	%naughtsee	Of course you can get as abstract as you want
2016-10-17 19:46:00	@ajimu	it really is, but you can't read it without tons of background because philosophers are academics buried in context
2016-10-17 19:46:14	@ajimu	there's nothing complicated about philosophy
2016-10-17 19:46:21	@ajimu	it's the reading it part that's fucking hard
2016-10-17 19:46:28	@ajimu	assholes
2016-10-17 19:46:31	%naughtsee	lol
2016-10-17 19:46:37	@quinn	that's like saying cs isn't complicated you just need to spend a lot of time learning how everything works
2016-10-17 19:46:45	@quinn	that's LITREALLY what something being complicated is
2016-10-17 19:46:47	@ajimu	not really
2016-10-17 19:46:50	@quinn	w/e
2016-10-17 19:47:20	@ajimu	I get what you're saying but I'm at dinner and on a phone so I'll take a rain check on explaining myself and ask for good faith for now
2016-10-17 19:47:36	@quinn	if every other piece of jargon in a philosophy text requires research to understand to understand, that's complicated
2016-10-17 19:47:59	@ajimu	the practice of philosophy isn't inherently complex but the job and study is
2016-10-17 19:48:02	@ajimu	it doesn't have to be
2016-10-17 19:48:06	@ajimu	but that's how things are
2016-10-17 19:48:22	@ajimu	unlike compsci which has real complexity
2016-10-17 19:48:40	@quinn	philosophy is all about responding to ideas, right
2016-10-17 19:49:12	@quinn	i don't get how the fruit of people exploring the same ideas for millennia can be simple to understand and respond to
2016-10-17 19:49:34	%naughtsee	because philsophy is just a way of thinking
2016-10-17 19:49:37	@ajimu	that part isn't
2016-10-17 19:49:40	%naughtsee	and if you're good at philosophy
2016-10-17 19:49:47	%naughtsee	Then you should be able to explain what you think, simply
2016-10-17 19:49:50	@JX7P	i never heard the phrase 'take a rain check' until this guy i was supposed to meet a few weeks ago had a seizure and vomited all over the supermarket floor 
2016-10-17 19:49:52	%naughtsee	So that others can understand that
2016-10-17 19:49:58	@JX7P	and i can't remember the name of that effect
2016-10-17 19:50:10	@JX7P	you know, of spotting something more often when you are introduced to it
2016-10-17 19:50:13	%naughtsee	yeah I can't either after my episode at the supermarket
2016-10-17 19:50:14	@ajimu	frequency illusion
2016-10-17 19:50:19	@quinn	i've heard that angle that philosophy is just a way of thinking
2016-10-17 19:50:21	@quinn	maybe for you it is
2016-10-17 19:50:30	@ajimu	there's another obscure name but I can't remember that one
2016-10-17 19:50:42	@JX7P	we used to call it the baader-meinhof complex
2016-10-17 19:50:48	@JX7P	oh wow
2016-10-17 19:50:56	@quinn	i used to think it was just a point of view or w/e, but studying it further, i start to think that's not all
2016-10-17 19:51:03	@quinn	i don't think it's all about the questions and answers
2016-10-17 19:51:14	@quinn	or participating in a dialectical process
2016-10-17 19:51:20	@JX7P	i'm just going to carefully form memory traces linking 'rain check,' 'frequency illusion,' and 'baader-meinhof complex' for future use
2016-10-17 19:51:34	@quinn	and i also think that developing that mindset is a difficult, complicated process
2016-10-17 19:51:44	@quinn	hence, phenomenology of spirit
2016-10-17 19:51:54	@quinn	JX7P: back me up here!
2016-10-17 19:52:26	@JX7P	quinn: much of sociology involves the same thinking with unity of metaphysics and science
2016-10-17 19:52:43	@quinn	what?
2016-10-17 19:52:56	@quinn	that's not the sociology i was taught
2016-10-17 19:53:24	@JX7P	likely you were taught positivist sociology as you're an anglo
2016-10-17 19:53:33	@JX7P	but dialectic of enlightenment is an example of that unity in action
2016-10-17 19:53:49	@quinn	i don't know what you mean by the unity
2016-10-17 19:54:26	%naughtsee	I dont know what you mean for most of your sentences
2016-10-17 19:55:05	@quinn	philosophy is partially an approach, but it's one developed through understanding and examining a long tradition of thinkers and seeing what they did wrong and right
2016-10-17 19:55:24	@JX7P	well, if one looks at dialectic of enlightenment, you note that it analyses fascism and how the enlightenment could produce something so irrational without relying on any empirical measurement. it instead uses (surprise) the dialectical approach
2016-10-17 19:55:33	@quinn	the phenomenology of spirit is a book hegel wrote to detail the development of his conciousness and relation to "science" or w/e
2016-10-17 19:55:37	@quinn	haven't finished it
2016-10-17 19:56:04	@quinn	JX7P: what the fuck
2016-10-17 19:56:30	@JX7P	it is a critique 
2016-10-17 19:56:33	@quinn	oh it's a book i thought you were talking about
2016-10-17 19:56:39	@quinn	I haven't READ IT
2016-10-17 19:57:04	@JX7P	just like marx's 'critique of political economy' (capital) or going back to kant even
2016-10-17 19:57:06	@quinn	you're saying that book is an exemplar of unifying metaphysics of science for a sociological aim
2016-10-17 19:57:48	@quinn	or more generally that a part of important philosophical development is connecting and reconciling the differences between traditions and ideas
2016-10-17 19:58:46	@JX7P	one must look at the possibilities of building a world where people can be "different without fear" in analysis, rather than considering the disembodied facts and forgetting the sociohistorical context
2016-10-17 19:59:05	@quinn	JX7P: i'd say i like that approach
2016-10-17 19:59:16	@quinn	idk what that has to do with what the "tradition" of philosophy is
2016-10-17 19:59:33	@JX7P	largely i'm just attacking narrow empiricists here
2016-10-17 19:59:50	%naughtsee	So then if sociology here is taught through a positivist lens, what is the alternative JX7P?
2016-10-17 20:00:05	@quinn	JX7P: who here is a narrow empiricist?
2016-10-17 20:00:14	@JX7P	quinn, hopefully no one
2016-10-17 20:00:19	@quinn	naughtsee: normativity?
2016-10-17 20:00:33	@quinn	at least that's the dichotomy in econ
2016-10-17 20:00:48	%naughtsee	I think I found it
2016-10-17 20:00:49	@ajimu	I don't think philosophy of science or math are really just a way of thinking
2016-10-17 20:00:50	%naughtsee	Antipositivsm
2016-10-17 20:01:00	@JX7P	i think i have some nice source on frankfurt school approach, one sec
2016-10-17 20:01:01	@quinn	normativity=how shit should be,positivity=predictive
2016-10-17 20:01:04	@ajimu	but I think philosophy applied to life can be much simpler
2016-10-17 20:01:15	%naughtsee	ajimu: +1
2016-10-17 20:01:18	@JX7P	a nice blog article iirc
2016-10-17 20:01:22	@quinn	who gives  A FUCK about applying philosophy to life
2016-10-17 20:01:27	@quinn	WE'RE ARMCHAIRS
2016-10-17 20:01:33	@quinn	if itS APPLICABLE, its DISPROVABLE

2016-10-17 20:02:00	@quinn	naughtsee: this is a philosophy channel dude
2016-10-17 20:02:14	@quinn	u new?
2016-10-17 20:02:26	%naughtsee	n but apparently you're missing the point m8
2016-10-17 20:02:36	%naughtsee	Have fun in your ivory tower
2016-10-17 20:02:51	@quinn	:') it was a prank dude
2016-10-17 20:02:53	@JX7P	http://oldhickorysweblog.blogspot.co.uk/2011/01/frankfurt-school-1937-max-horkheimer_28.html, yes, this one is nice summary
2016-10-17 20:03:35	@quinn	at the same time, an important aim of philosophy is satisfying curiosity
2016-10-17 20:03:53	@quinn	i don't think that's somehow low or foolish
2016-10-17 20:04:29	@quinn	hell, if you're such a fuckin fanatic about sartre then you should be interested as hell in using DAT RADICAL FREEDOM to pursue anything interesting
2016-10-17 20:06:38	%naughtsee	nah
2016-10-17 20:06:42	@kori	naughtsee: you into n e school of life

2016-10-17 20:07:13	@quinn	kori: that's some youtube thingy right?
2016-10-17 20:07:16	@kori	ye
2016-10-17 20:07:23	@kori	ive seen a lot of people calling alain de bottom a hack
2016-10-17 20:07:25	@kori	not sure y tho
2016-10-17 20:07:33	@quinn	tbh don't really like it
2016-10-17 20:07:44	@kori	botton*
2016-10-17 20:07:45	@quinn	i mean covering any question in 10m doesn't really due it justice
2016-10-17 20:07:51	@quinn	kori: be bottom :')
2016-10-17 20:07:58	@kori	;)
2016-10-17 20:08:10	%naughtsee	looks v interesting kori 
2016-10-17 20:08:17	%naughtsee	quinn: that's where my knowledge of all things comes from
2016-10-17 20:09:36	@ajimu	the goal isn't to do it justice though
2016-10-17 20:09:40	@quinn	kori: https://www.reddit.com/r/badphilosophy/comments/3vf6q0/do_you_like_philosophy_but_dont_like_to_read_are/cxna2fq here's a link to a reddit comment of someone complaining about it
2016-10-17 20:09:52	@quinn	i don't watch the videos so idk but here's why one dude doesn't like it
2016-10-17 20:09:57	@ajimu	it's to dilute it for a different audience
2016-10-17 20:10:52	@quinn	naughtsee: that's where most other philosophers get it too?
2016-10-17 20:11:29	@quinn	the unexamined life is not one worth living
2016-10-17 20:11:36	@quinn	t. lionel messi
2016-10-17 20:11:37	@JX7P	totally unrelated but i got my hair cut today and only thanks to minoxidil and nizoral does it look good (i have enough regrowth now to make my hairline no longer look like early stages of balding)
2016-10-17 20:11:57	@quinn	JX7P: there's hair regrowth shit that actually works?
2016-10-17 20:12:13	@JX7P	quinn, oh, yes, absolutely
2016-10-17 20:12:18	@ajimu	yeah
2016-10-17 20:12:39	@JX7P	minoxidil and nizoral are pretty much thoroughly supported by the evidence
2016-10-17 20:12:47	@ajimu	my hair health has been in slow decline
2016-10-17 20:13:01	@JX7P	and the evidence is good. i can see where it has induced growth in the temples
2016-10-17 20:13:25	@quinn	kori: i'm gonna watch the kant one, tell you what problems i have with it
2016-10-17 20:13:31	@quinn	i have an ok handle on him
2016-10-17 20:13:41	@quinn	JX7P: grats :D
2016-10-17 20:13:44	@ajimu	I recoil from kant but it's just bias
2016-10-17 20:13:49	@JX7P	and then there's finasteride, the gold standard, but i try to avoid ever needing that, as it's administered such that it is systemically active, and it has weird hormonal effects. whereas nizoral and minoxidil are topical and (mostly) well-localised
2016-10-17 20:13:57	@kori	naughtsee: did u read le post
2016-10-17 20:14:07	%naughtsee	kori: I did
2016-10-17 20:14:19	%naughtsee	but I'm also working so
2016-10-17 20:14:20	%naughtsee	pls hold
2016-10-17 20:14:22	@kori	is it a meme, and if so, is it a good meme
2016-10-17 20:14:22	@ajimu	finasteride counters the effects of ddt but doesn't induce growth itself
2016-10-17 20:14:34	@kori	sartre factored into that post
2016-10-17 20:15:18	@JX7P	for me kant is great because he so thoroughly laid the ground of universalism with his categorical imperative (which is flawed from a revolutionary perspective, but the kernel of the idea - that we can all reason in basically the same way - is a good one)
2016-10-17 20:15:44	@JX7P	ajimu, does this not typically cause follicles that recently became dormant to initiate growth again?
2016-10-17 20:15:47	@quinn	i really fucking like the categorical imperative
2016-10-17 20:15:51	@ajimu	the problem I have with your approach kori is that you pick up a few diluted versions of concepts and then run with those without understanding what they were being used for by the author or any other context
2016-10-17 20:15:54	@quinn	but i like the cirtique more
2016-10-17 20:16:05	@quinn	it's just for me really well executed
2016-10-17 20:16:16	@ajimu	JX7P: it prevents further loss iirc but doesn't initiate growth
2016-10-17 20:16:16	@quinn	like i don't agree with all the shit he says or even close but
2016-10-17 20:16:38	@kori	ajimu: well, yeah
2016-10-17 20:16:44	@quinn	his thoroughness is fantastic
2016-10-17 20:16:45	@kori	for that post it might have prevented Further Understanding
2016-10-17 20:17:14	@JX7P	i see the philosophical line that goes kant->hegel->marx & engels->[frankfurt school, mainly adorno]->postone as being a line of isolation and rebuilding
2016-10-17 20:17:36	@ajimu	I just want you to have a real grasp of what you're talking about
2016-10-17 20:17:49	@JX7P	the rational components of the previous thinker are rebuilt with new inferences drawn and frameworks established
2016-10-17 20:17:53	@ajimu	you can't use terms isolated from context in your understanding
2016-10-17 20:17:57	@quinn	kori: yeah i'm gonna be honest with you, this video on kant kinda sucks
2016-10-17 20:18:03	@ajimu	fold and unfold worked well for the post
2016-10-17 20:18:35	@JX7P	by postone, for example, we have really taken marx's theory of capital and fleshed it out to a fantastic extent
2016-10-17 20:18:48	@ajimu	what's postone
2016-10-17 20:19:22	@ajimu	tfw anxiety triggers don't trigger anxiety
2016-10-17 20:19:26	@ajimu	glorious
2016-10-17 20:19:55	@kori	quinn: RIP
2016-10-17 20:20:05	@JX7P	such that we can understand how aspects of capital which are only partially personified (i.e. the circulatory machinery, whose mask bankers wear) attract the ire of nazis and explain nazi irrationality when diverting fuel from the war on russia to run the trains to auschwitz instead
2016-10-17 20:20:44	@JX7P	ajimu, big figure in modern western marxism, jewish studies, and political economy
2016-10-17 20:20:55	@quinn	he takes the time to talk all about art for like 1-2m but spends 10s mentioning the critique
2016-10-17 20:21:05	@quinn	he doesn't mention the other 2 critiques
2016-10-17 20:21:11	@JX7P	he wrote "Antisemitism and national socialism" which is an analysis of the irrational antisemitism of nazis and how it came to be
2016-10-17 20:21:18	@quinn	or maybe he only mentions the critique of pure judgement
2016-10-17 20:21:37	@quinn	it's just one more aspect of the same treatment of kant
2016-10-17 20:21:42	@ajimu	yeah that's a common pattern in those videos
2016-10-17 20:21:55	@quinn	as if the only thing he ever did that's fucking valuable or interesting or worthwhile is the CATEGORICAL FUCKING IMPERATIVE
2016-10-17 20:22:03	@quinn	i LIKE THE IMPERATIVE BUT TEACHING KANT THAT WAY SUCKS
2016-10-17 20:22:04	@ajimu	the wittgenstein one makes fun of him for raising the ceiling in a house he was building by 2 cm
2016-10-17 20:22:26	@ajimu	oh huh
2016-10-17 20:22:30	@ajimu	@ postone
2016-10-17 20:22:37	%naughtsee	quinn: do you like philosophy because it lets you look down your nose at all the little idiots
2016-10-17 20:22:41	@ajimu	I think this is my first time hearing of him
2016-10-17 20:22:42	@quinn	he literally tried (succeeded for me) the platonist/aristotelian traditions
2016-10-17 20:22:55	@quinn	naughtsee: yes obviously dude
2016-10-17 20:22:59	@ajimu	I didn't understand that last sentence
2016-10-17 20:23:05	@JX7P	what i particularly like about postone is that he rehabilitate's hegel's Geist
2016-10-17 20:23:09	@quinn	im a petty little shit in an ivory tower and stuff
2016-10-17 20:23:23	%naughtsee	are we forgetting sarcasm tags
2016-10-17 20:23:26	@kori	I read that initially as PostOne
2016-10-17 20:23:29	@kori	weird
2016-10-17 20:23:30	%naughtsee	or are you being honest with yourself
2016-10-17 20:23:35	@quinn	naughtsee: lmao
2016-10-17 20:23:41	@ajimu	ur critique of bad teaching resonates with me
2016-10-17 20:23:52	@JX7P	noting how it's similar to the way in which the abstract aspects of capitalism move themselves despite having no physical form
2016-10-17 20:23:59	@ajimu	I haven't done shit with philosophy lately
2016-10-17 20:24:06	%naughtsee	kori: I read the thing btw
2016-10-17 20:24:12	%naughtsee	and digested like 2% of it

2016-10-17 20:24:24	@kori	whoops
2016-10-17 20:24:26	@kori	waht do you think
2016-10-17 20:24:31	@JX7P	also he analyses capitalism such that you can have capitalism without a market at all (i.e. in the USSR) which is important to critique USSR style state socialism
2016-10-17 20:24:31	@kori	yeah its kinda dense-ish
2016-10-17 20:24:34	%naughtsee	philosophical writing tends to go in one eye and out the other

2016-10-17 20:25:44	@JX7P	a relevant line from poston'e AS&NS: A capitalist factory is a place where value is produced, which “unfortunately” has to take the form of the production of goods, of use-values. The concrete is produced as the necessary carrier of the abstract. The extermination camps were not a terrible version of such a factory but, rather, should be seen as its grotesque, Aryan, “anticapitalist” negation. Auschwitz was a fac
2016-10-17 20:25:44	@JX7P	tory to “destroy value,” that is, to destroy the personifications of the abstract. Its organization was that of a fiendish industrial process, the aim of which was to “liberate” the concrete from the abstract. The first step was to dehumanize, that is, to rip away the “mask” of humanity, of qualitative specificity, and reveal the Jews for what “they really are”—shadows, ciphers, numbered abstractions
2016-10-17 20:25:45	@JX7P	. The second step was to then eradicate that abstractness, to transform it into smoke, trying in the process to wrest away the last remnants of the concrete material “use-value”: clothes, gold, hair, soap.

2016-10-17 20:30:39	@quinn	has marxist materialism gone too far [gone humanist]
2016-10-17 20:30:49	@quinn	ajimu: not rly idk
2016-10-17 20:30:53	@ajimu	bah
2016-10-17 20:30:56	@ajimu	thanks anyway
2016-10-17 20:30:57	@quinn	i've had good teachers
2016-10-17 20:31:02	@kori	[Gone Sexual]
2016-10-17 20:31:11	@kori	quinn: well, that's a weird question to answer
2016-10-17 20:31:17	@JX7P	humanism 4 lyf
2016-10-17 20:31:27	@kori	im going to try to use the least amount of analogies possible
2016-10-17 20:31:47	@quinn	kori: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontological_argument#Anselm here is an example your idea of a dissolution between concept and object
2016-10-17 20:31:47	@kori	nothingness is the base upon which reality is built
2016-10-17 20:31:53	%naughtsee	are ethics subjective dad?
2016-10-17 20:32:32	@quinn	naughtsee: no
2016-10-17 20:32:38	@quinn	they're derived from the world
2016-10-17 20:32:42	@kori	quinn: I skimmed that real quick and I can already tell this is not exactly what I mean
2016-10-17 20:32:54	@quinn	i know
2016-10-17 20:33:52	@quinn	but the point is that this kinda argument becomes a thing if you start claiming that concepts are somehow linked to objects
2016-10-17 20:34:13	@kori	we /metaphysics/ now
2016-10-17 20:34:30	@quinn	if by /metaphysics/ you mean basic epistemology sure
2016-10-17 20:34:55	@quinn	even a *narrow empiricist* would tell you that there's a pretty big gap between concept and object
2016-10-17 20:35:07	@ajimu	what does subjective mean in this context of ethics aren't subjective
2016-10-17 20:35:12	@kori	my model dictates that the concept of reality is basically a huge graph (rhizome) of all concepts, linked in the way my post described
2016-10-17 20:35:18	@ajimu	if#
2016-10-17 20:35:34	@quinn	what does a graph have to do with a rhizome
2016-10-17 20:35:46	@ajimu	they certainly digger between groups and individuals
2016-10-17 20:35:46	@kori	nothing, but we had an argument over this before
2016-10-17 20:35:53	@quinn	i don't think so
2016-10-17 20:35:55	@kori	and for people that dont know rhizomes, a graph is Good Enough
2016-10-17 20:36:15	@ajimu	I suspect we don't know rhizomes
2016-10-17 20:36:15	@quinn	are you trying to say that one side is objects other side is concepts
2016-10-17 20:36:27	@kori	anyways, as far as I know wrt how the universe works, that translates pretty much 1:1 to how Objective Reality (totally didnt come up with this now) works
2016-10-17 20:36:40	@quinn	that's just some empiricist dualism
2016-10-17 20:36:47	@quinn	which is spicy i guess if you're into that
2016-10-17 20:37:08	@kori	quinn: I don't really know what I'm doing
2016-10-17 20:37:16	@kori	so... maybe I'm into it? I dont know?
2016-10-17 20:37:17	@quinn	but first the obligatory: ACCOUNT FOR COLOURBLINDEDNESS
2016-10-17 20:37:18	@kori	needs research
2016-10-17 20:37:41	%naughtsee	Ok fine you win
2016-10-17 20:37:45	@kori	you mean, failing to see links?
2016-10-17 20:37:46	%naughtsee	I'm going to take philosophy courses now
2016-10-17 20:37:49	%naughtsee	are you happy
2016-10-17 20:37:49	%naughtsee	gosh
2016-10-17 20:37:53	@kori	naughtsee: kek
2016-10-17 20:37:56	@kori	are you enjoying this
2016-10-17 20:37:57	@quinn	im dead inside
2016-10-17 20:37:59	@kori	I certainly am
2016-10-17 20:38:03	%naughtsee	No
2016-10-17 20:38:04	%naughtsee	(yes)
2016-10-17 20:38:39	@kori	anyways quinn where were we
2016-10-17 20:38:45	@kori	right...
2016-10-17 20:38:47	@ajimu	dying slowly
2016-10-17 20:38:49	@quinn	idk dude
2016-10-17 20:39:04	@kori	if the conceptual reality maps 1:1 to objective reality, then <something>
2016-10-17 20:39:10	@kori	I haven't gotten that far yet :^)
2016-10-17 20:39:13	@ajimu	it doesn't
2016-10-17 20:39:19	@ajimu	the map is not the territory
2016-10-17 20:39:35	@quinn	platonist
2016-10-17 20:39:38	@quinn	you're a DIRTY PLATONIST
2016-10-17 20:39:55	@quinn	if you believe that concepts are a part of reality
2016-10-17 20:40:01	@quinn	you're a dirty fuCKING platonist
2016-10-17 20:40:14	@quinn	jk ily
2016-10-17 20:40:19	@ajimu	objective reality is unknowable, all we have are concepts
2016-10-17 20:40:19	@kori	well
2016-10-17 20:40:30	@kori	ive made the distinction between conceptual reality and objective reality
2016-10-17 20:40:37	@quinn	ajimu: that's idealism, except idealists care less
2016-10-17 20:40:39	@kori	concepts don't physically exist, they're mental abstractions
2016-10-17 20:40:48	@ajimu	well
2016-10-17 20:40:53	@ajimu	brains are physical
2016-10-17 20:40:57	@ajimu	information too
2016-10-17 20:41:13	@quinn	kori: you're saying that the mental abstractions, that aren't in reality, magically correspond with reality
2016-10-17 20:41:17	@kori	ajimu: numbers don't physically exist, for example
2016-10-17 20:41:23	@ajimu	I say this mostly to fuck with you, not because this matters
2016-10-17 20:41:28	@ajimu	yeah
2016-10-17 20:41:28	@kori	there's not a copy of the number one in the universe somewhere
2016-10-17 20:41:31	@kori	I dont remember where I saw  this
2016-10-17 20:41:36	@kori	maybe it was the pythagoreans
2016-10-17 20:41:38	@quinn	that's platonic dualism
2016-10-17 20:41:38	@kori	who believed it?
2016-10-17 20:41:42	@ajimu	plato
2016-10-17 20:41:55	@ajimu	somewhere there is a form of a 5
2016-10-17 20:41:59	@ajimu	jk jk
2016-10-17 20:42:05	@quinn	no that's what he believed
2016-10-17 20:42:24	@quinn	according to my prof anyways lol
2016-10-17 20:42:35	@ajimu	I think that's mostly a joke
2016-10-17 20:42:41	@ajimu	but I can't be sure
2016-10-17 20:42:50	@kori	quinn: anyways, conceptual reality only exists because objective reality exists
2016-10-17 20:42:53	@ajimu	on his part not your profs
2016-10-17 20:43:04	@kori	and after a certain point, they blur together and you can just follow on with your life
2016-10-17 20:43:11	@ajimu	we metaphysics now
2016-10-17 20:43:14	@kori	so no, mind is not over matter
2016-10-17 20:43:26	@ajimu	oh I see
2016-10-17 20:43:32	@ajimu	your philosophy is fear
2016-10-17 20:43:34	@kori	ajimu: we metaphysics like 9 mins ago
2016-10-17 20:43:42	@ajimu	fear of uncertainty
2016-10-17 20:43:57	@ajimu	you want to feel that you understand reality well enough to stop thinking about it
2016-10-17 20:44:04	@kori	t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-thanks ajimu 
2016-10-17 20:44:13	@kori	that was closer to objective reality than you might expect :^)
2016-10-17 20:44:15	@ajimu	here's a tip
2016-10-17 20:44:39	@ajimu	you don't have to invent the universe to make a pie from scratch
2016-10-17 20:44:51	@ajimu	stop worrying and examine when you need to
2016-10-17 20:45:24	@kori	"here's how to solve your problem: solve your problem"
2016-10-17 20:45:32	@kori	kek
2016-10-17 20:45:40	@ajimu	your solution is to try to understand the universe all at once
2016-10-17 20:45:42	@kori	ajimu: I didnt tell you about this thing
2016-10-17 20:45:48	@kori	I went to this free therapy thing in my city
2016-10-17 20:45:48	@ajimu	eating a steak before you learn how to chew is silly
2016-10-17 20:45:59	@ajimu	so yes stop worrying ahead of time
2016-10-17 20:46:00	@kori	and I told the lady about some stuffs that happened in my life
2016-10-17 20:46:04	@ajimu	how you do it is up to you
2016-10-17 20:46:09	@kori	and she went "have you tried getting a girlfriend"
2016-10-17 20:46:14	@kori	and I'm like "..."
2016-10-17 20:46:20	@ajimu	well have u
2016-10-17 20:46:20	@kori	t-thanks you too and left
2016-10-17 20:46:29	@ajimu	or a bf
2016-10-17 20:46:44	@kori	do or do not, there is no try
2016-10-17 20:46:54	@ajimu	yoda is stupid
2016-10-17 20:47:38	@ajimu	explain why trying matters
2016-10-17 20:48:32	%naughtsee	u need 2 try if ur gonna do m8
2016-10-17 20:48:39	%naughtsee	I'll take my phd now
2016-10-17 20:49:06	 *	ajimu gives naughtsee a paper that says Nazi phd
2016-10-17 20:49:10	@kori	ajimu: its a good step in overcoming anxiety
2016-10-17 20:49:17	@ajimu	this is like 5 jokes in one
2016-10-17 20:49:28	@ajimu	what else
2016-10-17 20:49:53	@kori	uh
2016-10-17 20:50:02	@kori	ye
2016-10-17 20:50:32	@kori	also, wrt "BELIEVE YOURSELF, ASHITA WOOOOOOOOOOOOO"
2016-10-17 20:50:39	@ajimu	there are DEGREES of success and failure
2016-10-17 20:50:40	@kori	that's why I picked The Fountainmeme
2016-10-17 20:50:48	@ajimu	you can do both at once
2016-10-17 20:51:03	@ajimu	you can accomplish some things along the way and fail at things along the way
2016-10-17 20:51:07	@ajimu	all or nothing thinking is bad
2016-10-17 20:51:22	@ajimu	go download a FUCKING CBT WORKSHEET ALREADY
2016-10-17 20:52:04	@ajimu	if the goal is to get a gf there are many other goals as well
2016-10-17 20:52:14	@ajimu	did u talk to a girl and face ur fear
2016-10-17 20:52:47	@ajimu	did u hit it off, make a friend, make her laugh, get a date, make her smile, find her interesting, etc
2016-10-17 20:52:55	@ajimu	this isn't black and white
2016-10-17 20:53:04	@ajimu	"there is no try" fuck yoda
2016-10-17 20:53:45	@ajimu	do you fail every time your code has a bug
2016-10-17 20:53:57	@ajimu	spoiler: yes, and no, and this is a stupid way to think about it
2016-10-17 20:55:24	@Thespis	don't let your dreams be dreams
2016-10-17 20:55:28	@Thespis	JUST
2016-10-17 20:56:40	@ajimu	kori: are you looking up cbt rn
2016-10-17 20:56:53	@kori	yes, lots of nasty porn is showing up
2016-10-17 20:57:11	@ajimu	type out the words
2016-10-17 20:57:20	@ajimu	seriously stop waiting
2016-10-17 21:07:43	@ajimu	do you want to be happy or not
2016-10-17 21:13:36	@ruukasu	guys can we start a commune some day
2016-10-17 21:15:09	@Thespis	we'd probably end up killing each other over the smallest differences
2016-10-17 21:16:16	@ajimu	epicurus invented communes and that worked out fine for a few centuries
2016-10-17 21:16:36	@ajimu	before the church took them over and invented monestaries
2016-10-17 21:17:58	@ruukasu	are communes just gift econ villages?
2016-10-17 21:18:06	@ruukasu	i've never been particularly clear on precisely what they are
2016-10-17 21:18:12	@Thespis	weren't his communities hierarchical and ideologically rigid
2016-10-17 21:19:29	@ajimu	he forbade sex iirc
2016-10-17 21:19:41	@ajimu	but idk about hierarchies
2016-10-17 21:19:58	@ajimu	he thought sex fucked everything up and never married
2016-10-17 21:20:16	@Thespis	pretty sure everything also devolved into a hero cult
2016-10-17 21:22:06	@Thespis	also monasticism was a thing among the greeks for well over a thousand years before the birth of christ
2016-10-17 21:23:11	@Thespis	though it wasn't monasticism in the modern sense, the lifestyles of several esoteric cults were essentially the precursors to early medieval monasteries
2016-10-17 21:24:27	@ajimu	that's plausible
2016-10-17 21:24:29	@Thespis	christian philosophy is based heavily on the philosophy of the cult of bacchus for example
2016-10-17 21:24:34	@ajimu	and yeah, a lot of christian ph--yeah
2016-10-17 21:25:42	@Thespis	tfw islam happened and ruined the chance of continuity for greek philosophy
2016-10-17 21:25:55	@Thespis	haraclius ;_;
2016-10-17 21:26:52	@ajimu	wot
2016-10-17 21:27:02	@ajimu	didn't islam basically save greek philosophy during the dark ages??
2016-10-17 21:27:16	@Thespis	the neoplatonic schools continued during christian eastern rome
2016-10-17 21:28:10	@Thespis	there were some hiccups but the neoplatonists themselves remained in the empire semi-thriving until the faith had to be strengthened and became a more significant cultural force, in response to islamic invasions
2016-10-17 21:28:51	@ajimu	interesting
2016-10-17 21:28:55	@ajimu	how do you learn this shit
2016-10-17 21:29:10	@Thespis	the classical texts that the islamic empire preserved were those that managed to be salvaged after the sacking of the cities in which the libraries they were housed had been for centuries
2016-10-17 21:29:15	@Thespis	staffed by greeks of course
2016-10-17 21:29:25	@Thespis	many have been lost to war
2016-10-17 21:30:01	@Thespis	the neoplatonists did escape to the islamic world for a while, but that was mostly in response to the growing fundamentalism at home in the empire, which was itself reactionary against islamic expansion
2016-10-17 21:30:27	@Thespis	I read a lot of wikipedia and the the sources in the citations
2016-10-17 21:31:09	@Thespis	the "islamic golden age" is very much overstated in my opinion
2016-10-17 21:31:38	@Thespis	much of the advances were born of contact with the romans and the east
2016-10-17 21:31:51	@Thespis	which could have happened in persia itself without islam
2016-10-17 21:32:43	@Thespis	though the early islamic economic system might have allowed the intellectual classes to thrive, I suspect this only made up for the losses caused by the violent expansion in the first place
2016-10-17 21:35:17	@Thespis	of course, I'm heavily biased here, since I obsess over obscure oriental languages and religions that were extinguished by the post-umayyad caliphate's arab nationalist policies
2016-10-17 21:35:38	@Thespis	but I don't think my analysis is entirely unfounded
2016-10-17 21:35:54	@Thespis	and I've seen some scholarly opinions that agree
2016-10-17 21:36:54	@Thespis	the turkish and mongol invasions were far more damaging to the advance of western culture for sure
2016-10-17 21:37:57	@Thespis	well, culture, not so much
2016-10-17 21:38:07	@Thespis	but social culture for sure
2016-10-17 21:38:22	@Thespis	that's the invasions themselves though, the effects of the invasions were often positive
2016-10-17 21:39:35	@Thespis	the plague was brought by the mongols for example, and the turks' destruction of rome and conquest of eastern europe was an important motivation for the reformation
2016-10-17 21:41:26	@Thespis	but you can't make me not salty about there not being a modern assyrian state or an egypt where people still speak egyptian and the library of alexandria still exists
2016-10-17 21:45:07	@Thespis	the romans weren't saints of course
2016-10-17 21:45:32	@Thespis	but at least they were cosmopolitan
2016-10-17 21:48:48	@ajimu	as a kid I used to have dreams about the library of alexandria
2016-10-17 21:59:19	@kori	I'm still a kid and I still do
2016-10-17 22:14:48	@kori	ajimu: i KNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW
2016-10-17 22:15:13	@ajimu	ugh
2016-10-17 22:15:20	@ajimu	did you look up cbt or not
2016-10-17 22:15:41	@ajimu	this depression is part of my identity now and I'm not doing anything about that thing is something you should be taking seriously
2016-10-17 22:16:15	@kori	yes
2016-10-17 22:16:18	@kori	Yes I did
2016-10-17 22:16:39	@kori	...wait. what do you think goes on in my head when I sing "I KNOOOOOOOOOOOOW"
2016-10-17 22:18:01	@ajimu	thoughts about the futility of life and the necessary of being happy while facing a sad reality
2016-10-17 22:18:07	@ajimu	the problem is that it's not futile and reality isn't sad
2016-10-17 22:18:41	@kori	its more of a hugbox thought really but I can see how you got that conclusion
2016-10-17 22:18:50	@kori	I dont think about sisyphus at all
2016-10-17 22:19:04	@kori	it's more of a "here I am" thing
2016-10-17 22:19:49	@ajimu	huh
2016-10-17 22:19:51	@ajimu	that's weird
2016-10-17 22:20:04	@kori	"
2016-10-17 22:20:09	@ajimu	better than I thought tho
2016-10-17 22:20:11	@kori	"You've been pushing all day, I know"
2016-10-17 22:20:18	@kori	man, thats one of the most comforting things ever
2016-10-17 22:20:54	@Thespis	anti-sisyphuseanism is really unhelpful for a lot of people I think
2016-10-17 22:21:18	@Thespis	many people's issues are distinctly non-sisyphusean
2016-10-17 22:21:31	@ajimu	I don't follow
2016-10-17 22:21:41	@ajimu	those two comments seem unrelated
2016-10-17 22:22:11	@Thespis	the depression I'm familiar with is not one that is characterized by a feeling of futility

2016-10-17 22:23:08	@kori	n e ways, glad we got that sorted, ajimu 
2016-10-17 22:23:24	@ajimu	what do you mean by antisisyphuseanism then??
2016-10-17 22:23:29	@kori	your assessment was fair but if thats what actually happened I'd be pretty fucking fucked rn
2016-10-17 22:23:29	@ajimu	same
2016-10-17 22:23:47	@ajimu	thus my concern
2016-10-17 22:24:19	@Thespis	have you read the myth of sysiphus
2016-10-17 22:24:26	@Thespis	sisyphus
2016-10-17 22:24:50	@ajimu	I read a 3 page thing called the myth of sisyphus but I got the impression it was an excerpt
2016-10-17 22:24:56	@ajimu	so: not sure
2016-10-17 22:25:02	@Thespis	it's an essay by albert camus
2016-10-17 22:25:11	@ajimu	I know
2016-10-17 22:25:17	@ajimu	how long is it
2016-10-17 22:25:28	@Thespis	a lot longer than three pages
2016-10-17 22:25:37	@ajimu	kk
2016-10-17 22:25:39	@ajimu	then no
2016-10-17 22:25:42	@Thespis	my copy is ~40 or 50
2016-10-17 22:25:44	@ajimu	I did read an excerpt
2016-10-17 22:25:56	@Thespis	it's meant to solve the problem of philosophical suicide
2016-10-17 22:26:04	@Thespis	but I didn't find it terribly helpful
2016-10-17 22:26:58	@ajimu	I never had the problem of philosophical suicide but what do you mean by anti
2016-10-17 22:27:03	@ajimu	what's the thing you're me hating
2016-10-17 22:27:06	@ajimu	negating
2016-10-17 22:27:11	@Thespis	characterizing depressive thought as sisyphusean, in that it's a feeling of futility, may help for some people, but my experience is more with a tantalusean sort of mindset
2016-10-17 22:27:11	@ajimu	fucking keyboard dictionary
2016-10-17 22:27:29	@Thespis	in that rather than doing useless things over and over
2016-10-17 22:27:47	@Thespis	we do things that we feel will help us, and we can see the reward right before us
2016-10-17 22:27:51	@Thespis	but we never get the reward
2016-10-17 22:27:59	@Thespis	and begin to wonder if the reward is there at all
2016-10-17 22:28:02	@Thespis	it's not futile
2016-10-17 22:28:11	@Thespis	it's not asinine
2016-10-17 22:28:36	@Thespis	it's not a huge difference, but I find it significant enough
2016-10-17 22:29:15	@Thespis	and more crushing than siyphuseanism, since at least there's a familiar grind there
2016-10-17 22:29:55	@Thespis	tantalusean depression is perpetually wanting something that has already been tasted
2016-10-17 22:30:05	@Thespis	with the knowledge that it is possible to have
2016-10-17 22:30:14	@ajimu	I agree with everything you're saying but I don't understand what you were saying with those first two sentences
2016-10-17 22:30:16	@Thespis	but not the motivation nor the means to achieve it
2016-10-17 22:30:32	@Thespis	mostly just the mention os sisyphus
2016-10-17 22:30:36	@Thespis	of sisyphus
2016-10-17 22:31:09	@Thespis	I've never really put this thought into words, so I might as well do it now before it fades
2016-10-17 22:31:34	@Thespis	but I always have a kneejerk reaction when somebody talks about sisyphus
2016-10-17 22:32:30	@kori	np: Sisyphus by Have a Nice Life
2016-10-17 22:32:36	@kori	Thespis: we're talking specifically about this song
2016-10-17 22:32:42	@Thespis	o-oh
2016-10-17 22:32:43	@kori	which has dark n edgy, but generic lyrics for the most part
2016-10-17 22:32:53	@kori	but then... theres this chorus thing?
2016-10-17 22:33:05	@kori	where he repeats "you've been pushing all day, I know"
2016-10-17 22:34:26	@ajimu	I was bothered by the reference to sisyphus
2016-10-17 22:34:30	@ajimu	because it's depressing as shit
2016-10-17 22:34:33	@ajimu	btw Thespis
2016-10-17 22:34:39	@ajimu	what you're describing is Alienation
2016-10-17 22:35:21	@Thespis	I don't necessarily mean it in a social context
2016-10-17 22:35:39	@Thespis	unless you don't mean that sort of alienation
2016-10-17 22:36:02	@ajimu	I don't mean it in a social context
2016-10-17 22:36:29	@ajimu	I mean e.g. the alienation of the worker from the product of their labor
2016-10-17 22:36:38	@ajimu	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx%27s_theory_of_alienation
2016-10-17 22:36:48	@Thespis	yeah, that's what I thought
2016-10-17 22:37:06	@Thespis	I guess it's parallel to that
2016-10-17 22:37:14	@ajimu	I'd say it's the same thing
2016-10-17 22:37:24	@Thespis	it's entirely self-imposed though
2016-10-17 22:37:32	@ajimu	not really
2016-10-17 22:37:34	@Thespis	or at least self-perpetuate
2016-10-17 22:37:35	@Thespis	d
2016-10-17 22:37:44	@ajimu	that's how rightists think
2016-10-17 22:37:49	@Thespis	not your alienation
2016-10-17 22:37:59	@Thespis	I mean the tantaluseanism
2016-10-17 22:37:59	@ajimu	I don't mean it in that sense
2016-10-17 22:38:02	@ajimu	like
2016-10-17 22:38:27	@ajimu	there are a lot of things rightists tend to assume humans control
2016-10-17 22:38:35	@ajimu	they choose their own destiny and make their own decisions 
2016-10-17 22:38:37	@ajimu	blah blah
2016-10-17 22:38:58	@ajimu	a sufficiently good capitalist system allows negative liberty and from there your agency takes over and you're responsible for whatever
2016-10-17 22:39:05	@ajimu	but basic psychology flips this on its head
2016-10-17 22:39:20	@ajimu	humans aren't rational and consciousness accounts for like 10% of decision making processes
2016-10-17 22:39:41	@ajimu	willpower is ineffective at accomplishing much of anything
2016-10-17 22:39:46	@ajimu	systems are everything, habit is everything
2016-10-17 22:39:50	@ajimu	people are just animals in the end
2016-10-17 22:42:04	@Thespis	I know about marxian alienation; I think my tantalusean mental state isn't the same thing though, since it's something that is usually not worked out of because a lack of motivation or a resignment to the mental status quo
2016-10-17 22:42:29	@ajimu	that's what I'm describing
2016-10-17 22:42:42	@ajimu	motivation, willpower, comfort zones, habit
2016-10-17 22:42:44	@ajimu	these are the obstacles
2016-10-17 22:42:58	@ajimu	there's a duality of blame here
2016-10-17 22:43:18	@ajimu	on the one hand you're the only one who can change it, but the methods you use have to be around building habits and systems, right
2016-10-17 22:43:46	@ajimu	but on the other, blaming yourself for it or acting like you have meaningful agency and are *choosing* this particular thing is terrible
2016-10-17 22:44:17	@Thespis	I can see what you mean
2016-10-17 22:44:43	@Thespis	I'll admit I'm just a bit married to the tantalus analogy, since it contrasts nicely with the sisyphus one I'm autistic about
2016-10-17 22:45:26	@Thespis	but in the absence of that I'd probably describe it as a mental form of marxian alienation
2016-10-17 22:45:32	@ajimu	it is a really awesome analogoy
2016-10-17 22:45:38	@ajimu	analogy*
2016-10-17 22:45:57	@Thespis	oy vey

2016-10-19 11:55:18	@ajimu	> look up a book I just read about on wikipedia
2016-10-19 11:55:26	@ajimu	> it's got 2 reviews on goodreads
2016-10-19 11:55:28	@ajimu	rip
2016-10-19 12:44:40	@ruukasu	guys seagate announced an $85 5TB hard drive
2016-10-19 12:44:43	@ruukasu	its happening
2016-10-19 12:45:24	@kori	happening status: it's
2016-10-19 12:45:44	@ruukasu	seriously, it was like a year ago that I spent $130 each on 4TB drives
2016-10-19 12:48:11	@ruukasu	3.25 cents/gb before, 1.7 cents/gb once that hard drive gets released
2016-10-19 12:50:24	@ruukasu	in a RAID6, that was $1040 for 24TB, and now it's $860 for 40TB
2016-10-19 12:50:26	@ruukasu	i love the future
2016-10-19 13:05:48	@ajimu	I love how cheap storage is now
2016-10-19 13:07:52	@kori	mom caught me listening to noise and she thinks its bad for my health
2016-10-19 13:07:59	@ruukasu	you know people who spend their lives preparing for zombie apocalypses that never happen
2016-10-19 13:08:08	@ruukasu	for the last year or two i've been doing that with data
2016-10-19 13:08:11	@ruukasu	it's rly fun
2016-10-19 13:08:46	@ruukasu	the other day i spent 12 hours trying to get this complex system involving several virtual machines working
2016-10-19 13:09:20	@ruukasu	in theory it would be capable of basically downloading any mediawiki install (wikipedia, encyclopedia dramatica, puella magi, etc) into a .zim file which you can then read from a wiki reader like kiwix
2016-10-19 13:09:35	@ruukasu	i got it mostly set up but there'sa bug that i reported and the guy is working on i think
2016-10-19 13:10:06	@ruukasu	i already have wikipedia, wiktionary, wikibooks, wikiversity, and like 6 others in english, japanese, and esperanto
2016-10-19 13:10:16	@ruukasu	but i didn't make the dumps myself, the guy who wrote the program with the bug did
2016-10-19 13:10:41	@ruukasu	once i can make them myself there's no limit to how much junk i can store other than my hard drives
2016-10-19 13:10:47	@ruukasu	which amazingly still have a few tb left to fill
2016-10-19 13:12:11	@ruukasu	kori one time i played death grips for my mom and she just kinda said "you don't listen to that" as a statement of fact
2016-10-19 13:12:21	@ruukasu	and i said "i do tho" and she kinda stared at me in disbelief
2016-10-19 13:24:12	@ruukasu	I thought of a better way to think of the RAID array:
2016-10-19 13:24:26	@ruukasu	$170 sacrifice/investment for the array itself, giving no usable storage
2016-10-19 13:24:35	@ruukasu	and then $17 per terabyte thereafter
