2014-12-06 22:22:50	~uguubot	I'd Just Like To Interject For A Moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.

2014-12-06 22:26:10	&Kalashnikovs	Honry, that's one of the reasons
2014-12-06 22:26:11	@eleeko	so the backwards combatibility is hardware based and you can play every ps1 / ps2 game, off disc with great upscaling etc Honry
2014-12-06 22:26:20	&Honry	Makes sense then
2014-12-06 22:26:23	@eleeko	thats the only reason people pay so much
2014-12-06 22:26:31	&Kalashnikovs	Gran Turismo 2 on the launch PS3
2014-12-06 22:26:32	&Kalashnikovs	SO GOOD
2014-12-06 22:26:36	@eleeko	collectors view it as the essential playstation
2014-12-06 22:26:57	@eleeko	idc cos emulation makes everything look even better
2014-12-06 22:27:02	&Kalashnikovs	I agree
2014-12-06 22:27:05	@eleeko	and ps2 emulation is near perfect
2014-12-06 22:27:07	&Kalashnikovs	PS2 emulation on the PC is top tier
2014-12-06 22:27:10	&Kalashnikovs	same person
2014-12-06 22:27:11	+brushy	That's the reason why we have the 60GB launch PS3 back then
2014-12-06 22:27:35	+brushy	but I really agree, PS2 emulation overtook it now
2014-12-06 22:27:42	+brushy	plus emulation is cheap :D
2014-12-06 22:27:44	@eleeko	yeah
2014-12-06 22:27:52	@eleeko	gamecube emulation is perfect too
2014-12-06 22:27:58	@eleeko	tfw no xbox OG emulation tho
2014-12-06 22:28:00	@eleeko	like none
2014-12-06 22:28:16	+brushy	because microshit keep making money selling halo remakes
2014-12-06 22:28:25	@eleeko	I don't think thats why
2014-12-06 22:28:34	+brushy	oh?
2014-12-06 22:28:34	@eleeko	its just nobody has figured it out
2014-12-06 22:28:55	@eleeko	brushy: >implying emulator devs care about microshits bussiness goals
2014-12-06 22:29:03	@eleeko	if they could make it, they'd make it
2014-12-06 22:29:31	@eleeko	they might get it eventually, for a loooong time saturn emulation basically didn't exist
2014-12-06 22:29:32	+brushy	true
2014-12-06 22:29:34	@eleeko	but lots works now
2014-12-06 22:29:43	@eleeko	still not perfect tho
2014-12-06 22:29:52	+brushy	I wonder if you could virtualize the xbone
2014-12-06 22:30:14	@eleeko	i think ps4 / xbone emus will come a lot quicker
2014-12-06 22:30:30	+brushy	yeah, the hardware for it is more mainstream
2014-12-06 22:30:38	@eleeko	yeah
2014-12-06 22:30:41	+brushy	so the software wouldn't be as 'specialised'
2014-12-06 22:30:43	@eleeko	like ps3 emulation tho
2014-12-06 22:30:45	@eleeko	probably never
2014-12-06 22:30:47	&Kalashnikovs	I want a new mouse
2014-12-06 22:30:56	@eleeko	who gonna emulate cell
2014-12-06 22:31:08	&Kalashnikovs	Looking at the Naos 7000
2014-12-06 22:31:13	&Kalashnikovs	eleeko, not any time soon
2014-12-06 22:31:19	@eleeko	yes
2014-12-06 22:31:22	+brushy	I remember playing a PS1 game on my PC back in the day
2014-12-06 22:31:24	&Kalashnikovs	Same with eggsbox 360 PPC emulation
2014-12-06 22:31:47	@eleeko	ps1 emulation has like 97% library support
2014-12-06 22:31:49	@eleeko	shit works great
2014-12-06 22:31:50	+brushy	like physically reading the disc and playing it on my computer
2014-12-06 22:31:59	&Kalashnikovs	tfw PS2 emulation is more like 70%
2014-12-06 22:32:07	&Kalashnikovs	some of the obscure weeb games i like don't work
2014-12-06 22:32:12	@eleeko	but everything you want to play basically works
2014-12-06 22:32:22	+brushy	yeah
2014-12-06 22:32:38	@eleeko	lots of obscure weeb games do work
2014-12-06 22:32:42	@eleeko	what games Kalashnikovs
2014-12-06 22:32:45	&Kalashnikovs	I said some
2014-12-06 22:32:56	+brushy	which games Kalashnikovs?
2014-12-06 22:32:58	&Kalashnikovs	Tokyo Extreme Racer Zero is one of them
2014-12-06 22:33:03	&Kalashnikovs	Wangan as fuck
2014-12-06 22:33:32	+brushy	I thought you were going to say some weird rape emulator
