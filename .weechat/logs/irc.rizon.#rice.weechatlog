2014-11-26 12:41:20	+dcat	kyubiko: switching to colemak is one of the best things I've done since discovering *nix on a computer
2014-11-26 12:41:33	+kyubiko	dcat: why?
2014-11-26 12:42:04	LIESard	I switched to Dvorak while I was still on Windows 8
2014-11-26 12:42:09	+lpf	mad typing speed/productivity increase i guess
2014-11-26 12:42:11	+dcat	my fingers flow over the keyboard instead of awkward positioning of the hands
2014-11-26 12:42:18	+dcat	not as much stress for the fingers
2014-11-26 12:42:18	LIESard	But Windows kept switching it back to QWERTY
2014-11-26 12:42:22	LIESard	God damn

2014-11-26 12:42:55	+dcat	fuck being fast
2014-11-26 12:42:56	+kyubiko	that's how long it took me to type this
2014-11-26 12:43:00	+kyubiko	from the s
2014-11-26 12:43:05	+dcat	type at whatever rate you like

2014-11-26 12:43:16	+dcat	but qwerty is made to ruin your fingers

2014-11-26 12:43:43	%cappuccino	dcat doesn't have a desktop saved yet. Save one with .desktop URL
2014-11-26 12:44:13	+dcat	it's an archaic layout meant to separate the keys as much as possible
2014-11-26 12:44:16	@Demoness	how does qwerty ruin your fingers?
2014-11-26 12:44:28	+dcat	it was used on typewriters, and if you typed to fast, the printing heads would jam
2014-11-26 12:44:38	@Demoness	wow neat
2014-11-26 12:44:51	@Demoness	is it hard to learn dvorak after being on qwerty for so long?
2014-11-26 12:44:55	+dcat	so they placed the characters that were used consecutively as far away from eachother as possible
2014-11-26 12:45:10	+kyubiko	Not only as far away
2014-11-26 12:45:16	+dcat	I don't know about dvorak, but it took me 3 weeks to adjust to colemak
2014-11-26 12:45:17	+kyubiko	into positions that the hand won't naturally go to
2014-11-26 12:45:28	@Demoness	colemak, never heard of it

2014-11-26 12:45:41	+lpf	dcat: did you keep the qwerty layout on your keyboard?
2014-11-26 12:45:51	+lpf	or did you replace them/get a coolmak layout
2014-11-26 12:46:01	+dcat	I'm on a thinkpad
2014-11-26 12:46:04	@Demoness	sounds interesting although in all honestly I use my keyboard less for typing and more for gaming these days
2014-11-26 12:46:16	+dcat	but my stationary keyboard doesn't have keycaps
2014-11-26 12:46:18	@Demoness	though in an office environment the prospects of increasing effiency hold intrest
2014-11-26 12:46:48	+lpf	dcat: i mean when you were adjusting to it
2014-11-26 12:47:33	+dcat	I don't understand
2014-11-26 12:47:39	+dcat	do you mean the print on the physical keys?
2014-11-26 12:48:03	+lpf	yes i mean this: what print layout were you using at the time you were learning/getting used to colemak?
2014-11-26 12:48:21	+dcat	qwerty
2014-11-26 12:48:30	+dcat	I put it on my phone to know where the keys were
2014-11-26 12:48:34	+lpf	okays
2014-11-26 12:48:39	+dcat	but I tried to use it as little as possible
2014-11-26 12:48:48	+lpf	i might switch to coolmak and print a reference sheet someday
2014-11-26 12:49:10	+lpf	i'm on a thinkpad and dont want to try removing and repositioning the keys
2014-11-26 12:49:21	+dcat	yeah
2014-11-26 12:49:25	+dcat	I'm on a x200s

2014-11-26 13:17:37	Traxex	still bests the consoles =3
2014-11-26 13:17:47	@Demoness	no its not, it was a big upgrade for me i had a 7700 sapphire
2014-11-26 13:18:06	@Demoness	i used to get severe frame lag in some games with a lot of particle effects
2014-11-26 13:18:12	@Demoness	not anymore!
2014-11-26 13:18:13	Traxex	i got the gtx 970 =3 still yet to boot up my new rig >_> been sitting here in the corner for like a week now

2014-11-26 13:18:35	Traxex	didnt they change the cooler tho too?
2014-11-26 13:18:46	+esmth	probably
2014-11-26 13:18:58	+esmth	i mean, the gpu itself is the same
2014-11-26 13:19:08	+esmth	the card as a whole is a little diffeent
2014-11-26 13:19:18	Traxex	yeah, should put a beatdown on the ps4 tho as i understand it

2014-11-26 13:21:47	@Demoness	i paid $200 at the time? it was earlier this year
2014-11-26 13:22:29	Traxex	wait, is 290 the same as 290x?
2014-11-26 13:22:33	@Demoness	no
2014-11-26 13:22:42	+esmth	the 290x has 256 more shaders
2014-11-26 13:22:49	+esmth	and 4 more rops
2014-11-26 13:22:58	+esmth	and 50mhz faster
2014-11-26 13:23:29	@Demoness	i almost made that mistake buying the 270x, i walked out with just a 270 hd 
2014-11-26 13:23:29	+esmth	53mhz :^)
2014-11-26 13:23:32	@Demoness	or some shit
2014-11-26 13:23:44	@Demoness	it was remarkably cheaper and of course a much worse video card
2014-11-26 13:23:54	+esmth	the 270x is just clocked higher than a 270
2014-11-26 13:24:01	+esmth	the 265 is the cut down one
2014-11-26 13:24:08	+esmth	1280 shaders vs 1024
2014-11-26 13:24:22	@Demoness	whichever i almost bought had much worse reviews and wouldn't have been an upgrade

2014-11-26 13:24:45	@Demoness	thats all i know
2014-11-26 13:24:56	+esmth	im excite for the 390x even though i probably wont be getting it
2014-11-26 13:27:57	@Demoness	MSI or Asus?
2014-11-26 13:28:06	@Demoness	isnt MSI the usual choice?

2014-11-27 15:55:59	cobcorn	less than 30 minutes to install
2014-11-27 15:56:04	+Naughtsee	Antergos has a livecd that installs everything for you, whatever DE you want etc
2014-11-27 15:56:07	+Naughtsee	even just the Arch base system
2014-11-27 15:56:10	cobcorn	yeah that too
2014-11-27 15:56:14	cobcorn	that exists
2014-11-27 15:56:21	+Naughtsee	It's the tits, guy
2014-11-27 15:56:23	LIESard	Ok, well I'll just go for it another time
2014-11-27 15:56:35	LIESard	The partitions are fucked up so I'm going to have to reinstall Fedora anyways
2014-11-27 15:56:36	+Naughtsee	Yeah! get comfy with fedora 
2014-11-27 15:56:54	LIESard	And by the time Fedora 21 comes out, there'll be all the updated stuff
2014-11-27 15:57:05	LIESard	Like, spectrwm 2.6.1
2014-11-27 15:57:07	LIESard	And stuff
2014-11-27 15:57:13	cobcorn	arch has the aur <3
2014-11-27 15:57:15	LIESard	I mean, Arch is probably the better alternative
2014-11-27 15:57:16	LIESard	Yeah
2014-11-27 15:57:20	LIESard	But oh well
2014-11-27 15:57:35	+Naughtsee	AUR is bae, but I end up building my stuff from git anyway
2014-11-27 15:57:40	cobcorn	same
2014-11-27 15:57:41	Perkybutts	I run Antergos, fuck installing arch from scratch.

2014-11-27 15:58:15	+Naughtsee	takes about two hours to restore my arch system from scratch now
2014-11-27 15:58:29	cobcorn	pf
2014-11-27 15:58:29	+Naughtsee	LIESard: lol, arch has the pkgbuild system which will install most deps for you
2014-11-27 15:58:35	cobcorn	yup
2014-11-27 15:58:37	Perkybutts	Naughtsee: That's where you went wrong ;).

2014-11-27 15:59:56	LIESard	*Arch
2014-11-27 15:59:56	cobcorn	probably should start with antergos
2014-11-27 16:00:02	LIESard	No.
2014-11-27 16:00:04	LIESard	Arch.
2014-11-27 16:00:07	cobcorn	it is arch
2014-11-27 16:00:09	cobcorn	just an install script
2014-11-27 16:00:11	+Naughtsee	Just follow the beginner guide
2014-11-27 16:00:14	cobcorn	ew

2014-11-28 15:01:29	DANtheBEASTman	^ is the beginning of a line \s is whitespace * is a modifier for 0 or more matches.. so it matches a string at the beginning of a line containing 0 or more whitespace chars and replacing them with nothing
2014-11-28 15:02:06	+Naughtsee	good ol' sed. I forgot you could remove all whitspace with that
2014-11-28 15:02:10	DANtheBEASTman	+ is like * but matches one or more, which may be slightly more appropriate but would likely do the same thing
2014-11-28 15:03:42	DANtheBEASTman	I guess you could've also done 's/^ +//'

2014-11-28 17:20:54	@Demoness	zoloft is terrible, especially for men
2014-11-28 17:21:05	@Demoness	it kills the sex drive and pretty much will make you feel nothing but apathy
2014-11-28 17:21:22	+Naughtsee	Just do fun drugs instead, like ecstasy

2014-11-28 17:21:49	@Demoness	infact, the body eventually comes to rely on it creating the chemical in the body instead of the body naturally doing so. Some people have even grown tumors in the colon who have taken it over the years

2014-12-05 15:43:55	%oneesama	but gentoo works for me
2014-12-05 15:43:57	%oneesama	and I like it
2014-12-05 15:44:05	@anshin	thanks you for participating in my survey
2014-12-05 15:44:08	%oneesama	you're welcome
2014-12-05 15:46:35	@anshin	thank* wow
2014-12-05 15:46:38	~kori	I now have this theory
2014-12-05 15:46:59	@anshin	?
2014-12-05 15:47:04	~kori	you can be satisfied with a distro but there's always your perfect distro somewhere
2014-12-05 15:47:28	+dcat	kori, anshin, oneesama
2014-12-05 15:47:34	+dcat	what's your current os?
2014-12-05 15:47:34	%oneesama	hi?
2014-12-05 15:47:39	%oneesama	gentoo x86
2014-12-05 15:47:40	+dcat	and wm
2014-12-05 15:47:45	%oneesama	awesome
2014-12-05 15:48:09	@anshin	antergos because I didn't want to setup arch by hand, openbox because I haven't found anything I like better. strongly considering swm and wmutils for my next install
2014-12-05 15:48:28	+dcat	anshin: brotip: openbsd
2014-12-05 15:48:36	%oneesama	the only thing I miss about arch is the easy systemd support

2014-12-05 15:48:41	@anshin	why openbsd?
2014-12-05 15:48:50	%oneesama	gentoo and systemd looks like a ton of undocumented configuration changes
2014-12-05 15:49:14	@anshin	also, alternative theory: gnu/linux sucks and everyone can feel that something is missing from their distros
2014-12-05 15:49:30	~kori	dcat: CRUX/dwm
2014-12-05 15:49:31	%oneesama	that's a better theory

2014-12-05 15:52:06	~kori	friendly reminder bitrig 1.0 is OUT
2014-12-05 15:52:09	@anshin	is it source-based?
2014-12-05 15:52:49	~kori	anshin: as with all *BSDs
2014-12-05 15:52:51	~kori	yes and no.
2014-12-05 15:53:06	@anshin	> all *BSDs
2014-12-05 15:53:19	@anshin	what if I make a *BSD that doesn't have a ports system
2014-12-05 15:54:01	~kori	you don't "make" a BSD
2014-12-05 15:54:09	@anshin	semantics
2014-12-05 15:54:30	~kori	then nobody would use it because ports rock and packages suck
2014-12-05 15:54:36	~kori	and it would die
2014-12-05 15:54:43	~kori	and then my initial statement would stay true
2014-12-05 15:55:00	@anshin	it wouldn't *stay* true because for a time it would have been untrue
2014-12-05 15:55:40	@anshin	and also I think you underestimate the viability of binary packages
2014-12-05 15:55:40	~kori	s/stay true/be true again/
2014-12-05 15:55:41	zugg	kori: and then my initial statement would be true again
2014-12-05 15:55:53	~kori	anshin: on a *BSD, packages invariably suck
2014-12-05 15:56:09	@anshin	why
2014-12-05 15:56:16	+dcat	^
2014-12-05 15:56:32	~kori	the flexibility the ports collections gives you outweighs all possible advantages packages may have
2014-12-05 15:56:33	@anshin	also that would have been a useful response when I asked whether it's source based
2014-12-05 15:56:48	+dcat	I disagree
2014-12-05 15:56:49	~kori	unless you're on a weak system, there is no reason to not use ports
2014-12-05 15:56:53	@anshin	really? nice, except the advantage in my case is that binary packages won't set my system on fire
2014-12-05 15:57:00	+dcat	with openbsd, using ports is discouraged
2014-12-05 15:57:10	~kori	dcat: I know
2014-12-05 15:57:30	~kori	also, let me just say this
2014-12-05 15:57:36	~kori	*BSD ports suck also
2014-12-05 15:57:41	~kori	compared to how CRUX does things
2014-12-05 15:57:56	+dcat	how does crux do thing?
2014-12-05 15:57:59	~kori	Pkgfiles > complicated recursive makefiles all day
2014-12-05 15:58:12	@anshin	have you noticed you tend to shill whatever you use at a given moment and then condemn it when you move on to something new

2014-12-05 15:59:35	+dcat	kori: so?
2014-12-05 15:59:49	~kori	anshin: one thing FreeBSD did right w/ ports was the dialog
2014-12-05 15:59:57	~kori	for you to select the compilation options you want
2014-12-05 16:00:13	+dcat	freebsd is just as shitty as linux
2014-12-05 16:00:15	~kori	dcat: Pkgfiles are many times simpler than a port Makefile, for example
2014-12-05 16:00:25	%oneesama	hmmm
2014-12-05 16:00:28	%oneesama	opinions? http://a.pomf.se/svozxn.png
2014-12-05 16:00:37	~kori	you have a build() function, and you have the definitions at the top
2014-12-05 16:00:40	+onodera	weeb/10
2014-12-05 16:00:49	%oneesama	specifically about the black/white contrast
2014-12-05 16:00:59	+onodera	go for the grainy comfy photograph walls
2014-12-05 16:01:00	~kori	pkgmk is a relatively simplistic bash script that takes care of all the details
2014-12-05 16:01:17	~kori	its 747 lines long
2014-12-05 16:01:24	cobcorn	oneesama: qt
2014-12-05 16:01:29	~kori	could be shorter if they werent using some retarded case for options
2014-12-05 16:01:36	~kori	for $FLAG in $@ or some shit like that
2014-12-05 16:01:51	+onodera	how is that retarded?
2014-12-05 16:01:57	+onodera	I'm doing the same in my scripts
2014-12-05 16:02:00	+dcat	>for $FLAG in $@
2014-12-05 16:02:01	~kori	onodera: you can't do shit like -duszh or whatever
2014-12-05 16:02:05	+dcat	python in shell
2014-12-05 16:02:06	~kori	you have to do -d -u -s -z -h
2014-12-05 16:02:14	+onodera	kori: ah I always do that anyways
2014-12-05 16:02:19	~kori	dcat: I meant for FLAG in $@
2014-12-05 16:02:19	~kori	sorry
2014-12-05 16:02:31	+dcat	still the same

2014-12-05 16:02:42	@anshin	bad design
2014-12-05 16:02:45	@anshin	bad
2014-12-05 16:02:48	~kori	wait no...
2014-12-05 16:02:52	+dcat	the right way to do it is;
2014-12-05 16:03:04	+dcat	case $BLAH in
2014-12-05 16:03:05	~kori	weird, I thought pkgmk did this
2014-12-05 16:03:06	+dcat	blah)
2014-12-05 16:03:12	~kori	it does case $1 in 
2014-12-05 16:03:14	~kori	-i
2014-12-05 16:03:15	~kori	etc
2014-12-05 16:03:31	~kori	I remember seeing something that did for FLAG in $@ though
2014-12-05 16:03:43	@anshin	bash should have introduced good abstractions for dealing with arguments
2014-12-05 16:03:51	~kori	while getopts...
2014-12-05 16:03:58	@anshin	getopts is utter shit
2014-12-05 16:04:00	+dcat	regardless
2014-12-05 16:04:09	+dcat	source based is retarded in this day and age
2014-12-05 16:04:14	@anshin	nah
2014-12-05 16:04:16	+onodera	I'm using
2014-12-05 16:04:17	+onodera		for flag in "$@"; do
2014-12-05 16:04:17	+onodera	case "$flag" in

2014-12-05 16:04:26	+onodera	without the for you can't have multiple flags

2014-12-05 16:05:13	+dcat	kori: cause we don't have more than 2 main cpu architectures
2014-12-05 16:05:19	@anshin	dcat: while I agree that binary packages make much more sense *most* of the time, many packages I use have compile time options that I want to configure
2014-12-05 16:05:23	%oneesama	ooh
2014-12-05 16:05:25	%oneesama	I have an idea
2014-12-05 16:05:32	@anshin	dcat: and I want my package manager to keep track of my hand-compiled packages
2014-12-05 16:05:34	~kori	dcat: why does the arch matter
2014-12-05 16:05:38	DANtheBEASTman	so last night I made a script that takes all the gifs webms pngs and jpgs from whatever dir you're in and makes a webpage with them
2014-12-05 16:05:38	+dcat	anshin: I agree that options are important
2014-12-05 16:05:57	@anshin	kori: because the compilation for a particular system doesn't result in significant speed gains over the binary distributions
2014-12-05 16:05:58	DANtheBEASTman	it's ugly, but I had a great fap session with it
2014-12-05 16:06:17	+dcat	but just because you're using binary packages, doesn't mean you can't have options
2014-12-05 16:06:39	~kori	I want the option of not having options
2014-12-05 16:06:41	@anshin	dcat: but in this day and age, we still have to compile certain software to leverage those options
2014-12-05 16:06:42	~kori	:D
2014-12-05 16:06:44	+dcat	it just means you have one package for every option
2014-12-05 16:06:46	%kyubiko	dcat: >lsw 0.3 released: download
2014-12-05 16:06:51	%kyubiko	from the suckless website

2014-12-05 16:06:58	%kyubiko	or something else
2014-12-05 16:07:01	+dcat	no idea
2014-12-05 16:07:04	@anshin	one package for every option is a very messy idea

2014-12-05 16:07:29	Tsuga	It has a nice feel
2014-12-05 16:07:37	+dcat	Tsuga: thanks
2014-12-05 16:07:43	@anshin	you have to have a package for every combination, so the package repos grow exponentially for each compile time option
2014-12-05 16:08:02	@anshin	12**12 144 packages for any software with just 12 options
2014-12-05 16:08:07	@anshin	wait
2014-12-05 16:08:08	@anshin	not 144

2014-12-05 16:08:20	Tsuga	after trying a dozen times I found out sxhkd should be executed before swm

2014-12-05 16:08:29	%kyubiko	there's prints titles, and it doesn't use xcb
2014-12-05 16:08:35	+dcat	they managed to put lsw and wname in the same binary

2014-12-16 19:22:28	JnNy	ubuntu seems too easy?
2014-12-16 19:22:32	%Nux	id seriously start with ubuntu like Naughtsee said
2014-12-16 19:22:33	JnNy	might as well give myself a bit of a challenge
2014-12-16 19:22:34	+Naughtsee	there's no such thing m8e
2014-12-16 19:22:48	+Naughtsee	I mean, if you can read a wiki and follow the steps, then you should be fine
2014-12-16 19:22:52	%Nux	but sudo apt-get purge unity
2014-12-16 19:22:52	+Naughtsee	with arch that is
2014-12-16 19:22:55	%Nux	if you do
2014-12-16 19:23:04	+Naughtsee	or install xubuntu like a pro

2014-12-16 22:31:02	frwny	Basically, if I have mpd playing, no other sound works
2014-12-16 22:31:10	frwny	Like if I load a youtube video it has no sound
2014-12-16 22:31:14	frwny	Same with games
2014-12-16 22:31:14	nullbyte	frwny: O

2014-12-16 22:32:15	Danavu	frwny: that's why people use pulse
2014-12-16 22:32:19	nullbyte	frwny: when I run custom i3status.sh which uses i3status and pipes it the now playing, it spits out "i3status: trying to auto-detect output_format setting"
2014-12-16 22:32:27	WizBright	I am also using pulse haha
2014-12-16 22:32:35	frwny	Danavu: pulse is shit
2014-12-16 22:32:40	frwny	I am not going to use it

2014-12-24 18:18:19	~kori	onodera: here's what you can do though
2014-12-24 18:18:21	+onodera	fvwm is bloated af but I like it
2014-12-24 18:18:23	~kori	you can make a vanilla port
2014-12-24 18:18:26	~kori	for mvwm
2014-12-24 18:18:28	~kori	that pulls from git
2014-12-24 18:18:31	~kori	and then you can commit that
2014-12-24 18:18:38	~kori	but this, this would go in a custom section
2014-12-24 18:18:46	~kori	it's very easy to create an overlay
2014-12-24 18:18:55	+onodera	kori: yeah there aren't any releases on github...
2014-12-24 18:19:01	~kori	yeah that kinda sucks
2014-12-24 18:19:12	+onodera	I can switch to fvwm
2014-12-24 18:19:20	~kori	eh
2014-12-24 18:19:25	~kori	won't that be a problem, tho

2014-12-24 18:20:14	~kori	I can see why this is going to be a problem.
2014-12-24 18:20:21	~kori	well
2014-12-24 18:20:26	~kori	do you have a problem with using fvwm?
2014-12-24 18:20:35	+onodera	not really
2014-12-24 18:20:41	~kori	mvwm is going to be tricky to create a port if you want this patch also
2014-12-24 18:20:53	~kori	>Reversed (or previously applied) patch detected!  Assume -R? [n] ^C
2014-12-24 18:20:58	+onodera	I actually ported the patch from fvwm to mvwm myself
2014-12-24 18:21:14	~kori	onodera: aye, well
2014-12-24 18:21:18	~kori	here's the new Pkgfile
2014-12-24 18:21:23	~kori	you have to delete the patch line

2014-12-24 18:21:29	~kori	http://sprunge.us/ZDPW

2014-12-24 18:21:35	+onodera	I don't use rounded corners atm anyways
2014-12-24 18:21:39	~kori	you'd need a .tar.gz release
2014-12-24 18:21:48	~kori	if you want to make a clean port with a patch
2014-12-24 18:22:25	~kori	esmth: ye make n e ports yet?
2014-12-24 18:22:38	~kori	I wanted to port infinality-bundle-ultimate
2014-12-24 18:22:43	~kori	but that's going to be a pain in the ass
2014-12-24 18:23:25	+onodera	why? The freetype2-infinality + fontconfig-infinality ports work fine right
2014-12-24 18:24:10	~kori	yeah but infinality-ultimate has extra patches

2015-03-07 16:08:53	%projektile	zxc, but im mostly asking because after dealing with doing it for days and seeing yours, there may be a way for you to update the notification instead of using pkill and launching a new one, so you get less lag time and flicker when it updates

2015-03-07 16:18:25	%projektile	zxc, really neat, and i feel like this got really confusing, all im trying to say is that if you're using your notification daemon to show that (what i think is dmenu now) you should be able to replace with an update command instead of killing it and launching a new one, which would make make it not lag and flicker 
2015-03-07 16:20:10	%st4g	you know, sometimes I think last.fm's 'recommendations' are decent, and then others they're trash

2015-03-08 14:39:35	zxc	Did you try out xdotool ?
2015-03-08 14:40:31	%projektile	no my wm has the same functionality for that built in

2015-03-08 14:41:36	JS1	zxc: that's kinda dwm's fault
2015-03-08 14:41:49	JS1	it doesn't really have support for stuff like that

2015-03-08 14:42:05	%projektile	dwm's panel isnt that bad but its true you're really not gonna get much moreout of it than it is
2015-03-08 14:42:18	zxc	Or mine for not knowing C
2015-03-08 14:42:41	%projektile	C isnt that hard if you have any reasonable programming experience
2015-03-08 14:42:51	%projektile	ermm
2015-03-08 14:43:30	%projektile	you *could* also review the source for xdotool and integrate what you need into dwm, not that it wouldnt be a hell of a project in itself

2015-03-08 14:44:20	%projektile	aye, then its probly a worthy project for you anyway tbh
2015-03-08 14:45:06	%projektile	idk any C++ but i know you'll come out better if you have a good understanding of C
2015-03-08 14:45:08	zxc	How so ?
2015-03-08 14:45:37	+onodera	JS1: oh sowwy
2015-03-08 14:46:29	%projektile	because most people who use OOP languages dont really understand the attributes that they're implementing {encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction}, implementingg them in a procedural syntax will help you to understand more thoroughlly how they apply
2015-03-08 14:46:30	zxc	Learning two programming languages at the same time is not a good idea for me though

2015-03-08 14:48:06	%projektile	aand how each attribute effects memory management and the structure of objects all together. and you're better off leading that with C before making it less of a pain with C++

2015-11-05 23:19:22	Naughtsee	These are the questions that need to be asked here
2015-11-05 23:19:31	Daft	So a temporary solution is to stop reproducing, but humans have needs

2015-11-05 23:29:01	gentsu	what makes them barbaric
2015-11-05 23:29:16	Naughtsee	Idk maybe cutting off parts of genitals of infants or children
2015-11-05 23:29:23	Naughtsee	burning off even
2015-11-05 23:29:28	gentsu	its mostly for religious/ceremonial reasons

2015-11-05 23:32:34	Naughtsee	Daft: not really no
2015-11-05 23:32:43	gentsu	Daft: maybe alittle hygiene benefit
2015-11-05 23:32:47	Naughtsee	I used to have some... before people showered regularly. Lol
2015-11-05 23:32:51	Hexarei	I'm a circumsized male, and I am *glad* I was circumsized. Only hygiene benefit is that you don't have to clean out dick-cheese

2015-11-05 23:33:03	Hexarei	Did I fucking stutter?

2015-11-05 23:34:02	Naughtsee	lol
2015-11-05 23:34:21	Hexarei	Also, in some cases, the foreskin is too small to allow the glans(head) to pass it, which can be painful and dangerous.
2015-11-05 23:34:40	gentsu	thats sad
2015-11-05 23:34:44	Naughtsee	From what I understand, the practice was abandoned until sometime in the early to mid 1900s in the US when a super-religious guy by the name of Kellog decided to make it for kids to masturbate and have good sex.
2015-11-05 23:34:58	Hexarei	Naughtsee: Ha. No.

2015-11-05 23:37:11	Enzyme	Idk, I feel like since there can't really be an answer, why is it anything but a discussion of differing views.
2015-11-05 23:37:25	gentsu	Enzyme: there can be an answer pretty easily 
2015-11-05 23:37:36	gentsu	Enzyme: because believing in a magic jew jitsu man from the sky is kind of dumb
2015-11-05 23:37:50	Hexarei	Enzyme: Because those who hold the beliefs they hold believe them. They hold them to be true.
2015-11-05 23:37:52	Daft	maybe they're just trying to prove to themselves that they're right 
2015-11-05 23:38:13	Enzyme	And I think that believing we're the highest power in the universe is arrogant, but it doesn't have to be a fight, does it?
2015-11-05 23:38:14	Daft	that's why unintelligent people never have discussion, because they can't accept that they might be wrong?  I dunno, I'm shit at philosophy 
2015-11-05 23:38:25	gentsu	Enzyme: arrogant? thats pretty silly
2015-11-05 23:38:29	◣	xoru (~xoru@uy.scuti) has quit
2015-11-05 23:38:30	Naughtsee	Some views are utterly ridiculous and harmful to people and any intelligent discussion since people just point to their invisible friend all the time and appeal to a higher authority to support their arguments...
2015-11-05 23:38:40	Hexarei	Christians, for instance, believe that there is one way to heaven. Jesus Christ. And if you don't believe in his power to save you from your sin, then you're going to Hell. If they truly believe that, and hold it as truth, then asking them to keep quiet is asking them to send you to Hell, in their eyes.

2015-11-05 23:39:37	Enzyme	Like, this is a tad contraversial, but the common practices and interpretations of the Bible are a bit backwards honestly.
2015-11-05 23:39:44	Enzyme	Rather, I believe so.
2015-11-05 23:39:56	Naughtsee	In the old testament, two daughters get their father drunk to have sex with him to procreate.
2015-11-05 23:39:56	gentsu	Enzyme: probably because they are made for a time long ago
2015-11-05 23:40:06	Naughtsee	God tells people to kill their sons.
2015-11-05 23:40:09	gentsu	Hexarei: you can ask for forgiveness at pretty much any time, its in the meme bible

2015-11-05 23:40:56	Naughtsee	Just because he didn't have him follow through with the act doesn't mean he didn't order it to be done
2015-11-05 23:41:06	Daft	there was a FO:NV casino named after it.  Gommorah? 
2015-11-05 23:41:13	Naughtsee	Also, god's got this weird thing for firstborn sons... so be on the lookout for plagues if you're the eldest.
2015-11-05 23:41:22	gentsu	your firstborn son is supposed to be your heir
2015-11-05 23:41:24	gentsu	so yeah
2015-11-05 23:41:29	Enzyme	That each religion's a message contextual for the time and just different messages from the same God.

2016-09-28 11:01:46	ebrock	and it says plugin loader 'python' was not found
2016-09-28 11:01:57	ebrock	even though i have python installed on my system

2016-09-28 15:07:30	@DANtheBEASTman	now find where your thing is looking for python
2016-09-28 15:08:14	@DANtheBEASTman	also, do you get a repl when you `env python` ?
2016-09-28 15:08:34	ebrock	yeah i do
2016-09-28 15:08:43	ebrock	its python 3.5.2
2016-09-28 15:08:58	@DANtheBEASTman	that's weird.. what distro you running on the rpi?
2016-09-28 15:09:04	ebrock	arch
2016-09-28 15:09:09	@DANtheBEASTman	ah.
2016-09-28 15:09:10	ebrock	but that shouldnt matter
2016-09-28 15:09:24	ebrock	im using minidlna
2016-09-28 15:10:01	@DANtheBEASTman	i too use minidlna. or did.. i think my partition with all my media is kill
2016-09-28 15:12:16	ebrock	ok
2016-09-28 15:12:20	ebrock	i switched it python3

2016-09-28 15:13:23	ebrock	whats the syntax error coming from
2016-09-28 15:13:29	ebrock	idk python very well
2016-09-28 15:13:52	+mitya	python3 requires print() rather than print <arguments>
2016-09-28 15:13:59	+mitya	python2 could just do the latter
2016-09-28 15:14:07	@DANtheBEASTman	yeah looks like it wants python2 instead of 3
2016-09-28 15:14:33	@DANtheBEASTman	if you can you figure out where it's asking for python point it at python2 instead of just python
2016-09-28 15:14:46	+mitya	yeah point specifically at python2

2016-09-28 22:26:07	@DANtheBEASTman	xvxii: some terminology real quick though: when you start tmux you create a tmux session. you can have multiple tmux sessions. "tabs" are called windows, and splits in windows are called panes
2016-09-28 22:26:33	xvxii	p = last window n = next window
2016-09-28 22:26:47	xvxii	x close
2016-09-28 22:26:55	@DANtheBEASTman	<prefix> ? will give you a list of all the current keybinds
2016-09-28 22:27:06	@DANtheBEASTman	first thing i'd suggest is changing the prefix to be C-a
2016-09-28 22:27:14	vistamon82	https://gist.github.com/henrik/1967800
2016-09-28 22:27:15	xvxii	seems a lot better
2016-09-28 22:27:16	+Aigis	URL: tmux cheatsheet · GitHub
2016-09-28 22:27:19	xvxii	i was gonna do c-z 
2016-09-28 22:27:24	xvxii	but c-a sounds good
2016-09-28 22:27:36	@DANtheBEASTman	no don't do C-z that's used for backgrounding processes
2016-09-28 22:28:29	mobo	spoonm did you forget
2016-09-28 22:28:33	mobo	did you forget uguubot
2016-09-28 22:28:51	xvxii	so why don't i need to restart weechat
2016-09-28 22:28:56	xvxii	if i xrdb ~/.Xresources
2016-09-28 22:29:08	@DANtheBEASTman	i quick little bash function that'll help you configure it and save your configuration: muxconf() { tmux "$@" && echo "$*" >> ~/.tmux.conf ;}
2016-09-28 22:29:35	xvxii	write this in rxvt?
2016-09-28 22:29:35	&lunarmage	xvxii: if you run weechat under screen or tmux then the multiplexer will keep the process alive
2016-09-28 22:29:54	@DANtheBEASTman	yeah run that from your shell, and then you can do `muxconf set prefix C-a`
2016-09-28 22:30:04	@DANtheBEASTman	but do it inside tmux, ofc
2016-09-28 22:30:17	@DANtheBEASTman	then instead of C-b you can do C-a
2016-09-28 22:30:38	xvxii	-bash: syntax error near unexpected token `{tmux'
2016-09-28 22:30:51	xvxii	oh
2016-09-28 22:30:53	xvxii	theres a space
2016-09-28 22:30:55	xvxii	my bad
2016-09-28 22:31:02	@DANtheBEASTman	and the changes will be saved the config file with that function too (but that function isn't persistent it will only last as long as that particular shell is open)

2016-09-28 22:45:46	@DANtheBEASTman	lunarmage: weren't you asking about easymotion for tmux?
2016-09-28 22:46:18	xvxii	DANtheBEASTman: so everytime u update xresources i dont have to restart the terminal client?
2016-09-28 22:46:21	xvxii	to see changes?
2016-09-28 22:47:33	@DANtheBEASTman	every time you update xresources you'll have to kill the terminals yes, but since tmux is a separate process, you just open a new terminal and then `tmux attach` (or just `tmux a`) and your tmux is as you left it
2016-09-28 22:47:52	@DANtheBEASTman	you can even open two terminals and attach to the same tmux session
2016-09-28 22:47:53	+LambdaComplex	killall -USR1 termite

2016-09-28 22:48:56	@DANtheBEASTman	i tried termite and i needed a special termite config for sometings, and other things weren't configurable and i had to edit gtk themes for that shit
2016-09-28 22:49:14	+LambdaComplex	like what?
2016-09-28 22:49:16	@DANtheBEASTman	whereas with urxvt all the config happens in xresources. i think that sucks less.
2016-09-28 22:49:22	&lunarmage	DANtheBEASTman: what
2016-09-28 22:49:22	+LambdaComplex	only thing i've edited the gtk theme for is padding i think

2016-09-28 22:49:48	@DANtheBEASTman	and yeah, padding. since termite has no control over the actual rendering.
