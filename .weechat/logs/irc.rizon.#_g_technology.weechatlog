2014-11-27 01:01:59	nvidia	I've contributed to GPL'd software before, but meh, if I were developing something of my own I'd make it permissively licensed to give people more freedom and control, and to be able to mix it with other code without having to worry about license incompatibilities.
2014-11-27 01:02:06	netburn	though I do support open source software

2014-11-27 01:07:37	Politik	    You are using SQLite in a jurisdiction that does not recognize the right of an author to dedicate their work to the public domain.

2014-11-27 23:18:47	coolguy1	well recompiling uses config files at some point in the process
2014-11-27 23:18:53	Pr0Wolf29	hmm true

2014-11-27 23:25:28	ThePengwin	you arent changing any of those configs, so compiling ith the confiuration options you set, rather than setting them at run tine will cut out all the extra junk of accomodating for thos config options

2014-12-05 16:14:47	+dymatic	Let me tell you, that's EXACTLY the kind of environment that nurtures fucking CS wizards.
2014-12-05 16:15:00	+dymatic	Since programming is something you can do for hours that requires no internet.
2014-12-05 16:15:08	DANtheBEASTman	(except for docs)

2014-12-06 13:28:56	mofukka	its not even a language its a prompt

2014-12-06 13:31:18	threeifbywhiskey	Why?

2014-12-06 13:31:39	threeifbywhiskey	If you're trolling, I commend the subtlety.
2014-12-06 13:32:00	mofukka	the definition of command line should be expanded to include calculator.
2014-12-06 13:32:03	threeifbywhiskey	No.
2014-12-06 13:32:04	%hal	Honestly my ideal shell would be MoonScript with a REPL and an easy way to call binaries.
2014-12-06 13:32:08	threeifbywhiskey	You can have a program named 42.
2014-12-06 13:32:14	mofukka	thats retarded
2014-12-06 13:32:15	%hal	And a filesystem library
2014-12-06 13:32:32	mofukka	some geniuses naming a program after a number
2014-12-06 13:32:38	mofukka	code42 would be fine
2014-12-06 13:33:00	mofukka	can 4+4 be a program
2014-12-06 13:33:05	%hal	yeah
2014-12-06 13:33:10	mofukka	can the terminal just answer 4+4=8

2014-12-06 13:34:17	mofukka	why

2014-12-06 13:41:43	mofukka	like i said the other day
2014-12-06 13:41:56	mofukka	my approach to software involves something i call ‘the bitch test'
2014-12-06 13:42:04	mofukka	its a simple test
2014-12-06 13:42:12	mofukka	if my bitch at the time can’t use it, it’s worthless
2014-12-06 13:42:25	mofukka	it isn’t gonna be productive or make me money
2014-12-06 13:42:44	mofukka	now while i wouldnt apply this to pieces of software like, my web IDE, cuz i build that for at least amateur nerds
2014-12-06 13:42:46	Nux	mofukka go read my thread in DG its what the courts gave me
2014-12-06 13:42:59	mofukka	id consider the terminal to require a pass on the bitch test

2014-12-06 13:43:18	mofukka	you guys dont ever have bitches using your computers, and couldn’t unless you dual booted windows
2014-12-06 13:43:26	mofukka	no not the lowest calling demonator
2014-12-06 13:43:30	mofukka	you calling my bitches dumb?
2014-12-06 13:43:41	mofukka	no just 50% roughly of ppl at large
2014-12-06 13:43:54	mofukka	nah 50% is correct
2014-12-06 13:44:22	Nux	mofukka i get what you are saying, but there is targeted software
2014-12-06 13:44:29	mofukka	now tell me you don’t imagine a bitch opening the terminal on the mac
2014-12-06 13:44:31	mofukka	typing 4+4
2014-12-06 13:44:38	mofukka	and giving up in about 10 seconds
2014-12-06 13:44:40	threeifbywhiskey	Bitches got the sense to pad their operators.
2014-12-06 13:44:49	mofukka	if their into CS sure
2014-12-06 13:44:54	mofukka	my job is to make it easier for people who aren't

2014-12-06 13:45:02	threeifbywhiskey	Your job?
2014-12-06 13:45:13	mofukka	i teach people coffeescript and python, instead of js and c#
2014-12-06 13:45:18	threeifbywhiskey	I don't believe you.
2014-12-06 13:45:24	Nux	threeifbywhiskey he does program

2014-12-06 13:45:35	Nux	threeifbywhiskey i can vouch on that
2014-12-06 13:45:37	threeifbywhiskey	Nux: Then why does he seem so plebian? :(
2014-12-06 13:45:42	mofukka	making more coders, that are better, is part of my lifes work

2014-12-06 13:46:13	Nux	threeifbywhiskey  he isnt pleb mofukka  is just a different breed
2014-12-06 13:46:20	Nux	is cool though
2014-12-06 13:46:23	Nux	really cool dude
2014-12-06 13:46:35	mofukka	thanks nux
2014-12-06 13:46:43	mofukka	i appreciate yo kind words
2014-12-06 13:46:50	threeifbywhiskey	mofukka: Why is Python > C#?
2014-12-06 13:46:57	threeifbywhiskey	Defend single-expression lambdas.
2014-12-06 13:47:14	mofukka	because C# is harder to learn and its really only more useful if you rely on advanced concepts
2014-12-06 13:47:34	mofukka	im pretty sure F# (or hell, IronPython) would be easier to learn with no background in C langs whatsoever
2014-12-06 13:47:44	mofukka	the {{ }}}) shit fucks everyone up
2014-12-06 13:47:45	Nux	plus python is similar to CS and JS
2014-12-06 13:47:48	Nux	same syntax
2014-12-06 13:48:09	mofukka	yea same w/ f# / C#
2014-12-06 13:48:29	mofukka	then the subject learns JSOn
2014-12-06 13:48:32	mofukka	and subsequently JS
2014-12-06 13:49:02	mofukka	and then they know braces and they just magically substepped that part of learning to program
2014-12-06 13:49:13	mofukka	since JSON is strict and also the simplest form of braces to understand
2014-12-06 13:49:24	threeifbywhiskey	...?
2014-12-06 13:49:35	threeifbywhiskey	What does "simplest form of braces" odd mean?
2014-12-06 13:49:44	mofukka	you didnt understand? go figure lol
2014-12-06 13:50:01	mofukka	because it is strict and doesn’t contain functions...
2014-12-06 13:50:24	mofukka	its a data structure that revolves around properly formed braces and neccessary for use in webapps even from coffeescript
2014-12-06 13:50:48	threeifbywhiskey	This nigga is actually sitting here telling me what JSON is.

2014-12-09 20:40:33	SirCmpwn	I think arch is about making the system your own
2014-12-09 20:40:37	SirCmpwn	more than simplicity
2014-12-09 20:40:55	SirCmpwn	it's easier to write systemd units than it is to write init scripts
2014-12-09 20:41:10	ca	it's not so easy to get rid of journald, just pass to rsyslog
2014-12-09 20:41:20	SirCmpwn	journald is easily the best part of systemd
2014-12-09 20:41:44	ca	arch should let you choose your init system during the install
2014-12-09 20:42:06	SirCmpwn	more difficult to maintain packages that give a shit
2014-12-09 20:42:10	SirCmpwn	especially in the AUR
2014-12-09 20:42:21	ca	>simplicity in maintaining arch themselves
2014-12-09 20:42:33	ca	it's not the simple distro, it's the distro with lazy maintainers
2014-12-09 20:42:33	SirCmpwn	the users are the maintainers
2014-12-09 20:42:47	SirCmpwn	if you don't give back to arch then you aren't really doing it right
2014-12-09 20:42:48	ca	only for the AUR
2014-12-09 20:43:14	SirCmpwn	you can contribute beyond the AUR
2014-12-09 20:43:25	ca	but it's a bit more time consuming
2014-12-09 20:43:28	SirCmpwn	I've sent patches along to pacman and the website
2014-12-09 20:43:35	SirCmpwn	of course none of them were merged, but w/e
2014-12-09 20:43:39	ca	gentoo has been more successful in gaining community support
2014-12-09 20:43:52	ca	for a wide range of alternatives instead of a single base system
2014-12-09 20:43:59	ca	gentoo does arch better than arch
2014-12-09 20:44:12	SirCmpwn	gentoo has users that know it's their responsibility to help maintain shit if they want it in their system
2014-12-09 20:44:23	SirCmpwn	arch has more users who just want other people to do the work
2014-12-09 20:44:48	SirCmpwn	if you want a selection in the install process, add it yourself
2014-12-09 20:45:16	ca	arch's "do it yourself" has been widely understood to be "make it a personal effort"
2014-12-09 20:45:18	SirCmpwn	init systems are particularly hard because you need to raise a team of contributors who are all willing to help in the large-scale effort involved
2014-12-09 20:45:20	prawn	can i just throw in that building a debian system with debootstrap is almost as "custom" as arch and the "bleeding edge" factor is lost when those 3 packages i want in the -git version from aur don't want to build for the life of me?
2014-12-09 20:45:22	ca	rather than "contribute to the main system"
2014-12-09 20:45:33	SirCmpwn	nah, I see it as contributing to the main system
2014-12-09 20:45:38	ca	arch users don't
2014-12-09 20:45:45	SirCmpwn	they see it wrong, then
2014-12-09 20:45:45	ca	and the arch way implies it that way
2014-12-09 20:45:48	SirCmpwn	be the change you want to see in the world

2014-12-16 19:04:57	reddN	Lobotomies provided evidence that there was something special about the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain located behind the eyes. Brain scanning techniques confirmed this. Prefrontal areas are activated when people exercise will power, make plans, or do creative thinking (Posner, 1993). The frontal lobes provide us with a capacity for comprehensive forward planning which is a hallmark of our species.

2014-12-18 23:34:58	emgram769	everyone can program and most people pick up JS first because it is really easy to make things on the web
2014-12-18 23:34:59	+Kunoichi	also, there are other acessible languages out there

2014-12-18 23:40:09	witheld	Play Music will also pretty much cache all your music
2014-12-18 23:40:18	witheld	Assuming you have the space
2014-12-18 23:40:22	+Kunoichi	do you have to pay for it tho?
2014-12-18 23:40:23	ThatGuy2	it would be great if  it didn't have a 20k song cap
2014-12-18 23:40:24	+aaboagye	Shabba: his neighbors put a sticky note on his truck saying he parked like an asshole
2014-12-18 23:40:26	witheld	nope
2014-12-18 23:40:30	witheld	and you can upload all your music
2014-12-18 23:40:33	+aaboagye	but he did a pretty good job if you ask me
2014-12-18 23:40:34	%Flygon	why?
2014-12-18 23:40:34	+Kunoichi	do you have to listen to ads?

2014-12-18 23:40:47	%Flygon	did he park in some special snowflake's spot?
2014-12-18 23:40:57	+Kunoichi	will google sell the music you listen to to the RIAA?
2014-12-18 23:40:58	Shabba	It's a street
2014-12-18 23:40:59	ThatGuy2	google music is good, but if you have more than 20k songs you're right fucked m8
2014-12-18 23:41:00	Shabba	There are no spots
2014-12-18 23:41:02	+aaboagye	"Thanks for parking like an inconsiderate asshole! - your neighbors" the note said

2014-12-18 23:41:24	+aaboagye	he even had his wheels turned into the curb

2014-12-18 23:41:42	Shabba	They can get fucked, you don't have a legal right to park on the street anyway

2015-01-03 01:52:48	ButchDeLoria	I did it thinking it would help the immediate issue.
2015-01-03 01:53:01	MineProTaco	What is the best bios to install in a freshly new pc?
2015-01-03 01:53:08	MineProTaco	>Inb4 gentoo
2015-01-03 01:53:19	ButchDeLoria	I didn't lose my EFI partition. What happens is that the motherboard forgets they exist.
2015-01-03 01:53:57	ButchDeLoria	So one either has to manually readd the partition via something like efibootmgr, rely on a recovery bootable, or (what I did) chroot into your install and rerun your bootloader's installer.

2015-01-05 01:42:47	~Combot	An integral is a mathematical object that can be interpreted as an area or a generalization of area. Integrals, together with derivatives, are the fundamental objects of calculus. Other words for integral include antiderivative and primitive. The Riemann integral is the simplest integral definition and the only one usually encountered in physics and elementary calculus. In fact, according to Jeffreys and Jeffreys, "it

2015-01-12 20:48:21	dennis_	how?
2015-01-12 20:48:38	+dymatic	You can literally just write that list to a file, and eval it later.
2015-01-12 20:48:46	dennis_	no
2015-01-12 20:48:54	+dymatic	No?
2015-01-12 20:48:57	dennis_	because classes can't be read and printed like such
2015-01-12 20:48:58	+dymatic	Oh, right.
2015-01-12 20:49:00	dennis_	I tried
2015-01-12 20:49:00	+dymatic	Class instances.

2015-01-12 20:49:48	+dymatic	There are two approaches here.
2015-01-12 20:50:06	+dymatic	You can make a function that builds your classes from strings, and have your list rebuild from a flat file each time.
2015-01-12 20:50:18	+dymatic	Or save an image of your Lisp REPL's state and reload that each time.

2015-01-12 20:51:01	+dymatic	No problem. You're using clisp, yeah?
2015-01-12 20:51:13	dennis_	yup
2015-01-12 20:51:21	dennis_	and how do I load the image?
2015-01-12 20:51:31	dennis_	do I just (load "image.mem")?
2015-01-12 20:51:38	+dymatic	I don't think load would work for that.
2015-01-12 20:51:43	dennis_	it might
2015-01-12 20:52:33	+dymatic	Actually, you may not be able to load it? That seems wrong, though.

2016-10-10 21:05:57	Bob_Dole	Cosmonaut, the Larrabee based chips have lots of cores, XEONs are just server/workstation variants of the mainstream CPUs, usually with multi-chip support.
2016-10-10 21:06:46	Bob_Dole	the high-end consumer processors are getting like 16 cores so the XEONs getting it should be expected too.
2016-10-10 21:08:01	Bob_Dole	the Larrabee derived chips, like Knights landing get away with lots of cores by using Pentium MMX derived cores with wide SIMD units bolted on, while the Core i and XEON chips just use big dies.
2016-10-10 21:08:46	Cosmonaut	your knowledge of fruits amazes me

2016-10-10 23:46:48	frabs	Then it tells me to follow the instructions I just followed that led me to that web page
2016-10-10 23:46:59	~Uncled1023	alright, from reading, if you opt out right now, and stay on that current build, you won't get any future updates
2016-10-10 23:47:05	~Uncled1023	since you aren't on a production build
2016-10-10 23:47:41	frabs	so it's a timing thing?
2016-10-10 23:47:52	~Uncled1023	otherwise, you can revert to the original os (using recovery images)
2016-10-10 23:47:53	~Uncled1023	yea
2016-10-10 23:48:05	~Uncled1023	we just started the next phase (redstone 2)
2016-10-10 23:48:13	~Uncled1023	so it will be awhile until the next production build
2016-10-10 23:48:35	aUsernameIsFineToo	all the windows machines in the university library were "upgraded" to windows 10 over the summer
2016-10-10 23:48:43	~Uncled1023	you coud change which insider feed you are on
2016-10-10 23:48:46	frabs	I might be better off to just reinstall then
2016-10-10 23:48:52	frabs	or fresh install
2016-10-10 23:49:03	~Uncled1023	go to the release one, and you can just sit for awhile
2016-10-10 23:49:20	aUsernameIsFineToo	i played around with one and it was full of bugs and trivial inconsistencies
2016-10-10 23:49:38	aUsernameIsFineToo	what happened to microsoft?
2016-10-10 23:50:08	frabs	oh, so I gotta wait until the next production build is installed to lock in to it
2016-10-10 23:50:15	~Uncled1023	frabs: yea
2016-10-10 23:50:49	~Uncled1023	or get a windows 10 recovery cd
2016-10-10 23:50:57	~Uncled1023	and i think you could downgrade using that
2016-10-10 23:51:07	frabs	and roll back to production build, then opt out

2016-10-10 23:52:11	~Uncled1023	AU then
2016-10-10 23:52:26	aUsernameIsFineToo	AU is when the explorer text alignment bug started appearing
2016-10-10 23:52:47	aUsernameIsFineToo	i have windows 10 enterprise in a vm for testing
2016-10-10 23:53:40	aUsernameIsFineToo	it's definitely a bug because it shows up in some places and not in others
2016-10-10 23:53:51	frabs	okay I understand it now. I'm opted out for 7 days, I go to Recovery to roll back, and it tells me it needs the files for the build I want to go to, so I just have to get those somehow
2016-10-10 23:54:15	frabs	thanks for the info
2016-10-10 23:54:28	~Uncled1023	yupp

2016-10-10 23:55:16	frabs	this was a Win7 machine
2016-10-10 23:55:40	aUsernameIsFineToo	if the installation you upgraded from was "genuine" as microsoft calls it the license should be tied to your motherboard
2016-10-10 23:56:28	aUsernameIsFineToo	in other words, you wouldn't need a key
2016-10-10 23:59:22	frabs	it wasn't really. it was just a transplanted hdd with w7 on it

2016-10-11 00:03:43	aUsernameIsFineToo	if you cared about your pc you wouldn't use windows 10 home
2016-10-11 00:03:56	frabs	this one has "pro" apparently
2016-10-11 00:03:59	aUsernameIsFineToo	because it'll make you want to throw it out your window
2016-10-11 00:04:19	aUsernameIsFineToo	pro isn't much better in terms of user-friendliness and configurability
2016-10-11 00:04:32	frabs	the home/pro distinction in w10 is kinda silly
2016-10-11 00:04:37	aUsernameIsFineToo	it really is
2016-10-11 00:04:42	starbow	win10 home has NO software RAID
2016-10-11 00:04:44	starbow	; _;
2016-10-11 00:04:53	aUsernameIsFineToo	pro should be the standard edition
2016-10-11 00:04:55	frabs	win10 home can't connect to a domain
2016-10-11 00:05:04	frabs	give us $100 to connect to a domain
2016-10-11 00:05:10	aUsernameIsFineToo	home editions have never had the ability to connect to domains
2016-10-11 00:05:12	aUsernameIsFineToo	since xp
2016-10-11 00:05:32	aUsernameIsFineToo	but windows 10 home feels like windows 8.1 with bing
2016-10-11 00:05:35	starbow	i agree aUsernameIsFineToo
2016-10-11 00:05:40	starbow	there should only be ONE edition of windows
2016-10-11 00:06:06	aUsernameIsFineToo	not everyone needs the ability to connect to a domain
2016-10-11 00:06:13	aUsernameIsFineToo	or the ability to disable data harvesting
2016-10-11 00:06:19	starbow	;)
2016-10-11 00:06:25	frabs	home -> data mines users, pro -> money mines businesses
2016-10-11 00:06:40	aUsernameIsFineToo	businesses use enterprise, not pro
2016-10-11 00:07:12	aUsernameIsFineToo	nobody should be running windows 10 home unless they have no other option
2016-10-11 00:07:41	aUsernameIsFineToo	i'd rather use windows 7 starter than windows 10 home

2016-10-12 16:25:16	Nuclear	Elon Musk wants to leave the planet and go to Mars and I want to go to the Moon and Venus. I think that's the future of civilization.
2016-10-12 16:25:19	aUsernameIsFineToo	now i wonder... between texas and california, which state would secede first?
2016-10-12 16:27:19	Vorda	Texas, California are just a bunch of cucks
2016-10-12 16:27:23	Vorda	they'd never actually do it
2016-10-12 16:28:01	Hospitaler	California is so cucked they don't even want to break up into multiple states
2016-10-12 16:28:38	Vorda	even though it'd be the best thing they ever did
2016-10-12 16:29:23	Vorda	vexillologists would be pissed off though
2016-10-12 16:29:30	Vorda	would ruin the US flag, adding more stars
2016-10-12 16:29:34	Hospitaler	I mean, at the very least, it should be north and south california
2016-10-12 16:29:42	Hospitaler	They're already different states as it is
2016-10-12 16:29:55	Vorda	Realistically LA needs to be its own state, same with NYC

2016-10-12 16:30:42	Vorda	hell the NYPD has 50,000 employees
2016-10-12 16:30:53	Vorda	that's more than some armies
2016-10-12 16:30:54	Hospitaler	NYC not being a state isn't so bad
2016-10-12 16:31:03	Hospitaler	But LA + SD + SF is a LOT of city for one state
2016-10-12 16:31:21	Vorda	yeah
2016-10-12 16:32:02	Vorda	San Jose too
2016-10-12 16:32:07	Vorda	San Jose is larger than SF
2016-10-12 16:32:22	Hospitaler	Eh, sort of. That entire are is really just huge suburban sprawl
2016-10-12 16:32:40	Hospitaler	The "SF Bay Area" as Craigslist likes to call it is enormous
2016-10-12 16:32:44	Vorda	fair point, there's no point where SF really ends and SJ begins
2016-10-12 16:32:53	Vorda	it just sort of flows together
2016-10-12 16:33:01	Hospitaler	Slowly becomes less suburban-y
2016-10-12 16:33:12	Hospitaler	And then it remains suburbia until SJ downtown
2016-10-12 16:33:19	Vorda	kind of like the Seattle/Tacoma/Kent area
2016-10-12 16:33:24	Vorda	just one big urban sprawl
2016-10-12 16:33:31	Hospitaler	I think bellevue touches all that too
2016-10-12 16:33:43	Hospitaler	But yeah, very similar
2016-10-12 16:33:47	Vorda	yup
2016-10-12 16:33:51	Vorda	and Everett

2016-10-18 00:57:43	kori	To bring out the virtues of Gentoo Linux on different operating systems, the Gentoo Prefix project develops and maintains a way of installing Gentoo systems in a non-standard location, designated by a "prefix".
2016-10-18 00:57:46	kori	Usually, Gentoo Linux's package manager (portage) installs in the root of the filesystem hierarchy known as /. On systems other than Gentoo Linux, this usually results in problems, due to conflicts of software packages , unless the OS is adapted like Gentoo/FreeBSD. Instead, Gentoo Prefix installs within an offset, known as a prefix, allowing users to install Gentoo in another location in
2016-10-18 00:57:48	kori	the filesystem hierarchy, hence avoiding conflicts. Next to this offset, Gentoo Prefix runs unprivileged, meaning no root user or rights are required to use it.
2016-10-18 00:57:50	kori	By using an offset (the "prefix" location), it is possible for many "alternative" user groups to benefit from a large part of the packages in the Gentoo Linux Portage tree.
