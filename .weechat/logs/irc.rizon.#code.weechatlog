2014-11-27 00:41:50	Naughtsee	please take notice
2014-11-27 00:41:59	&anshin	what's your question?
2014-11-27 00:42:17	+inuoppai	>not just asking
2014-11-27 00:42:24	Naughtsee	So I want to parse a string that has mutiple words in it to scanf, like, "Whatever Guy"
2014-11-27 00:42:35	Naughtsee	but scanf sees the space is like "oh shit, better only take what's before it"
2014-11-27 00:43:14	Naughtsee	How to put the entire string into the variable only after return is hit
2014-11-27 00:43:31	+inuoppai	Parsing a string from stdin, you mean?
2014-11-27 00:43:37	Naughtsee	yeah
2014-11-27 00:43:41	Naughtsee	Looking @ fgets() rn
2014-11-27 00:44:04	+inuoppai	Yea, go with fgets
2014-11-27 00:44:24	+inuoppai	What's this for? Doing anything interesting?
2014-11-27 00:45:30	Naughtsee	Not particularly. Making a database of manually written songs to learn structs. i.e. 'song' is a struct and I have an array of them that I write to a file n' stuff
2014-11-27 00:45:45	Naughtsee	manually written meaning I have to type artist, album, etc
2014-11-27 00:45:47	Naughtsee	:3
2014-11-27 00:46:46	+inuoppai	Doesn't sound like a beginner level project. So, don't use stdin for input.
2014-11-27 00:47:08	+inuoppai	stdin shouldn't be used for keying in shit.
2014-11-27 00:47:17	Naughtsee	What else would I use? I'm basically entering stuff and storing it
2014-11-27 00:47:18	+inuoppai	Parse arguments or read from a file.
2014-11-27 00:47:25	Naughtsee	args!!! ahhh!
2014-11-27 00:47:25	+inuoppai	Or treat stdin like a file and redirect files to your program.
2014-11-27 00:47:40	Naughtsee	it's like a menu driven thing, sec
2014-11-27 00:47:43	+inuoppai	You'll want basic serialization at least, work on that.
2014-11-27 00:48:13	Naughtsee	.-. woords

2014-11-27 00:48:26	Naughtsee	be gentle! I'm still figuring out what I wanna do 
2014-11-27 00:49:02	+inuoppai	Sure. We all were.
2014-11-27 00:49:25	+inuoppai	Okay, so, just looking at the first half...
2014-11-27 00:49:39	+inuoppai	In your song struct, you'll want to use char * instead of char[]
2014-11-27 00:49:44	+inuoppai	So you can deal with strings of any length
2014-11-27 00:49:52	+inuoppai	Instead of limiting yourself to MAX_LEN
2014-11-27 00:49:57	+inuoppai	Which may be either too short or too long.
2014-11-27 00:50:08	Naughtsee	I thought arrays couldn't be dynamically sized
2014-11-27 00:50:14	&anshin	they can be actually
2014-11-27 00:50:19	&anshin	but also
2014-11-27 00:50:25	+inuoppai	They don't. :) That's why you use char * instead
2014-11-27 00:50:28	+inuoppai	And allocate it at runtime
2014-11-27 00:50:32	Naughtsee	malloc pls
2014-11-27 00:50:37	&anshin	if your goal here is to learn about structs, don't get side tracked by the idea of doing things a proper way
2014-11-27 00:50:59	+inuoppai	Yea, this is pretty much advise for after you're done learning structs
2014-11-27 00:51:02	+inuoppai	Just things you should keep in mind
2014-11-27 00:51:19	+inuoppai	Consider making your song struct a linked list.
2014-11-27 00:51:35	+inuoppai	That way library can handle any number of songs
2014-11-27 00:51:45	+inuoppai	Okay now let's see the struct thing.
2014-11-27 00:51:58	Naughtsee	That makes a lot of sense actually... wow linked lists making real world sense.
2014-11-27 00:52:49	+inuoppai	Linked lists are the best. But just keep in mind that if you're going to deal with more than 1k songs just drop it and use another data structure.
2014-11-27 00:53:32	Naughtsee	I'm just tryna see if I can get this all written to a file and read back up on startup
2014-11-27 00:53:54	+inuoppai	Okay, good luck!
2014-11-27 00:53:59	Naughtsee	Thanks ! d:3
2014-11-27 01:00:51	+inuoppai	Naughtsee: btw, since you're using a typedef, you don't need it to be typedef struct Song { ... unless you intend to use "struct Song" somewhere later on.
2014-11-27 01:01:10	+inuoppai	You can just use typedef struct { ... } Song_t
2014-11-27 01:02:15	Naughtsee	oh! okay
2014-11-27 01:02:21	Naughtsee	Isn't is safer or something though
2014-11-27 01:03:57	+inuoppai	Yes, what you currently have is actually safer.
2014-11-27 01:04:21	+inuoppai	Because the latter is an alias to an unnamed struct.
2014-11-27 01:04:33	+inuoppai	Which could bite your ass in the future
2014-11-27 01:04:55	+inuoppai	(I doubt it would, though. Unless you're going to start including in multiple compilation units)
2014-11-27 01:07:05	+inuoppai	typedefs are a little bit overused when it comes to structs, though.
2014-11-27 01:10:14	Naughtsee	I just thought it was proper and made my life easier
2014-11-27 01:10:24	Naughtsee	instead of having to put "struct thing" I could just put "thing"
2014-11-27 01:15:20	+inuoppai	That's right. It does, but most programmers recommend using typedef only when hiding the fact that the type is a struct is alright.
2014-11-27 01:16:20	+inuoppai	Honestly, just screw them and do anything the way you want. In C, it'll usually become apparent quickly whether "conventions" are bullshit or if they have wisdom behind it, so feel free to do things your way until you an truly see why people spout the same "conventions" over and over again dogmatically.
2014-11-27 01:17:05	&anshin	^ this is actually also a pretty good way to live

2014-11-27 01:21:55	+inuoppai	Also because it's subjective and the result of experience. Trying to pass these precautions you take to other people who isn't as experienced is wrong.
2014-11-27 01:22:15	+inuoppai	This has crippled me in the past and it still does. Fuck conventions.
2014-11-27 01:22:35	Naughtsee	True. It's hard to watch people make their own mistakes, though. It probably all comes out of compassion and empathy.

2014-11-28 15:00:02	houj_n	it basically just reads in what's displayed on the monitor and sends input to another program that manages mouse movement and clicks
2014-11-28 15:00:28	houj_n	aka, it's like a facial recognition program, but for killing people in csgo
2014-11-28 15:00:59	BTC	You could take the same method and implement it into games like Diablo.
2014-11-28 15:01:00	houj_n	since lighting and environments are pretty static in video games, it works wonders compared to making it work outdoors

2014-12-03 19:51:00	&anshin	night
2014-12-03 19:51:32	+Jas	this got me kind of excited for some reason
2014-12-03 19:51:43	&anshin	new paradigm?
2014-12-03 19:51:52	&anshin	or just learning new things?
2014-12-03 19:52:07	+Jas	just learning new things
2014-12-03 19:52:36	&anshin	I'd love to start trying checking into prolog, but it's just too much
2014-12-03 19:52:42	&anshin	on top of everything else I'm doing
2014-12-03 19:52:46	+dymatic	I feel the same way.
2014-12-03 19:53:01	+Jas	i have no idea how to run prolog code though
2014-12-03 19:53:03	+dymatic	And I feel like it doesn't provide any real advantage. The way it has to reason about its rules just slows down execution time.
2014-12-03 19:53:26	&anshin	notation as a tool of thought
2014-12-03 19:56:15	+Jas	prolog compiler thing is named w32pl666.exe
2014-12-03 19:56:19	+Jas	dare i enter the magical realm?
2014-12-03 19:56:29	&anshin	ha
2014-12-03 20:03:09	+Jas	hm, i only get fib(X,1). -> X = 1
2014-12-03 20:10:10	+Jas	ah, you can ;
2014-12-03 20:20:36	+kori	how interested would you guys be in moving networks?
2014-12-03 20:21:02	+dymatic	NOPE
2014-12-03 20:21:22	+dymatic	That would be an adamant nope.jpg from me, at least.
2014-12-03 20:22:20	+Jas	yeah ima nope on that too
2014-12-03 20:22:22	+Jas	for no reason really
2014-12-03 20:22:27	+Jas	but why switch
2014-12-03 20:22:31	+kori	hmmm
2014-12-03 20:22:50	+Jas	it doesn't matter a whole lot to me, i'm only in #code and #rice now
2014-12-03 20:23:14	+dymatic	I just, managing multiple networks is a pain in the ass.
2014-12-03 20:23:21	+kori	just checking
2014-12-03 20:23:23	+dymatic	I'm too lazy to even start my client more than once every 100 days or so.
2014-12-03 20:23:38	Naughtsee	moving networks?
2014-12-03 20:23:44	Naughtsee	why would that be a thing
2014-12-03 20:26:28	+dymatic	Fuuck
2014-12-03 20:27:25	+dymatic	Moving from prefixed types in day programming to postfixed types in night programming is a tough transition.
2014-12-03 20:27:40	+dymatic	In the day it's "int x;"
2014-12-03 20:27:46	+dymatic	By night it's "let x: int;"
2014-12-03 20:33:29	&anshin	I intend to "move" networks for #code but I don't want to ask all of you to move
2014-12-03 20:33:35	&anshin	so instead I'm considering franchises
2014-12-03 20:34:01	+dymatic	What if we do that, but we have mirroring set up through a bot?
2014-12-03 20:34:11	&anshin	that's interesting actuall
2014-12-03 20:34:13	&anshin	actually*
2014-12-03 20:34:14	+Jas	first self-made prolog function: istwo(2). istwo(5) -> false. istwo(2) -> true. istwo(X) -> X = 2
2014-12-03 20:34:25	&anshin	it would definitely be messy, but it's plausible
2014-12-03 20:34:36	+dymatic	I've just been thinking of every possible use for IRC bots. I want to make the anonymous thing I was talking about for sure.
2014-12-03 20:34:45	+Jas	it could be cool actually

2014-12-03 20:36:28	+Jas	:^)
2014-12-03 20:36:42	&anshin	my vision is a better ecosystem for hackers, developers, and people who make things in general
2014-12-03 20:36:58	&anshin	computers are dying, but they're still crucial for makers
2014-12-03 20:37:20	&anshin	it can't be good for hackers if it can't be hacked
2014-12-03 20:37:21	+dymatic	Computers are dead for the consumer.
2014-12-03 20:37:37	+dymatic	The average consumer*
2014-12-03 20:37:44	&anshin	but operating systems are still aimed at the average consumer
2014-12-03 20:37:49	&anshin	that's where this began
2014-12-03 20:38:17	&anshin	but now it's grown into something else. I'm really disgusted with the state of the art
2014-12-03 20:38:23	+kori	anshin: read #rice for a bit eh
2014-12-03 20:38:32	+kori	scrollback too
2014-12-03 20:39:04	&anshin	kori: how small a network do you want?

2014-12-03 20:39:24	&anshin	kk
2014-12-03 20:39:26	+kori	since it has some users I want already

2014-12-03 20:39:54	+kori	Jas: this interests #code too
2014-12-03 20:40:00	&anshin	you agree that #rice is too heavy to move. are you planning to setup a new #rice or is it more #code?
2014-12-03 20:40:18	+kori	I'm currently setting up a "new #rice" kind of thing
2014-12-03 20:40:23	&anshin	kk
2014-12-03 20:40:55	+Jas	if you mutinetwork #code i'll make my webirc client
2014-12-03 20:41:21	&anshin	if I pursue dymatic's idea, being in one of the channels will be enough
2014-12-03 20:41:29	+Jas	wait maybe it's a bad idea to just load both channels into a single stream
2014-12-03 20:41:39	+Jas	if i type "hi" in it it's gonna be in both
2014-12-03 20:41:41	+kori	use relay bots
2014-12-03 20:41:43	+kori	:^)
2014-12-03 20:41:48	&anshin	huh. I just realized it doesn't have to be as messy as I thought
2014-12-03 20:42:07	+Jas	except if i have like on gmail, "send to [#X]"
2014-12-03 20:42:31	+kori	I'll copy paste what I said in #rice@iotek
2014-12-03 20:42:32	+Jas	<mirrorsenpai> | <anshin> it doesn't have to be as messy as I thought
2014-12-03 20:42:38	+kori	22:41 ~kori: why iotek can be a good thing
2014-12-03 20:42:39	+kori	22:41 ~kori: we have pretty much all the channels we want
2014-12-03 20:42:39	+kori	22:42 ~kori: so containerizing topics will be neater
2014-12-03 20:43:01	+kori	besides the obvious factor the network is more maleable and the owner is more acessible
2014-12-03 20:43:13	+kori	but anshin has his own network, no?
2014-12-03 20:43:16	&anshin	I do
2014-12-03 20:43:18	&anshin	but it's small
2014-12-03 20:43:20	+kori	mmm
2014-12-03 20:43:32	&anshin	as in, there are like three programmers small
2014-12-03 20:43:37	&anshin	and one of them is me
2014-12-03 20:43:43	+Jas	and one is a bot
2014-12-03 20:43:48	+dymatic	Holy shit, that female:male ration is pretty good on that server then.
2014-12-03 20:44:02	&anshin	there are more females than males actually
2014-12-03 20:44:08	&anshin	I think
2014-12-03 20:44:14	&anshin	they come and go quite a bit
2014-12-03 20:44:19	&anshin	so it's hard to keep track
2014-12-03 20:44:51	&anshin	ah, no, not more
2014-12-03 20:45:01	&anshin	it's a *very* small community
2014-12-03 20:45:20	&anshin	maybe 10 people or something
2014-12-03 20:45:39	+kori	22:31 iotek: There are 9 users and 55 invisible on 2 servers
2014-12-03 20:47:33	&anshin	this network looks a little too /g/
2014-12-03 20:48:12	+kori	anshin: iotek is home for nixers
2014-12-03 20:48:16	&anshin	I know

2014-12-03 20:48:31	+Jas	i thought it was some word play on teknik.io
2014-12-03 20:49:43	+kori	GNO
2014-12-03 20:51:45	&anshin	kori: why do you want to build there?
2014-12-03 20:51:52	+kori	I don't, though
2014-12-03 20:51:56	+kori	i'm exploring the options
2014-12-03 20:52:05	+kori	but I'm looking to move from rizon asap
2014-12-03 20:52:13	&anshin	for what reason?
2014-12-03 20:52:35	+kori	its part of the plan to distance #rice from /g/
2014-12-03 20:52:44	+kori	and to have more flexibility
2014-12-03 20:52:59	&anshin	sounds reasonable enough yeah
2014-12-03 20:54:02	&anshin	I don't have anywhere in particular in mind, as of now, just the general idea that I'm going to need more support and IRC is one place to find it
2014-12-03 20:55:28	+kori	my rationale for choosing iotek of all the places is that there's already ricers there
2014-12-03 20:55:30	+kori	for now, at least
2014-12-03 20:57:29	&anshin	yeah
2014-12-03 20:57:58	&anshin	and you explicitly want to be involved with some of the nixers crew

2014-12-03 21:27:36	+dymatic	I found the problem. Unit test was really stopping compilation.
2014-12-03 21:27:55	+dymatic	The infringing line:

2014-12-09 21:12:15	+Jas	not much really, i need motivation and inspiration i think
2014-12-09 21:14:03	Arathnim	Ah, the bane of every programmer.  Both always seem to be in short supply.
2014-12-09 21:14:13	+Jas	what about you? done anything cool lately?
2014-12-09 21:15:15	Arathnim	Learning erlang right now.  Decided to seriously learn a functional languange, and erlang seems pretty neat.
2014-12-09 21:15:47	+Jas	I don't think I've heard of stuff you made, you seem/sound really competent though
2014-12-09 21:16:05	+brkk	Arathnim https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MvKLOecT1I
2014-12-09 21:17:33	Arathnim	I've spend most of my last three years learning Ai and other topics, but i'm not even in college yet. I hope it'll provide some new information.
2014-12-09 21:17:50	+brkk	Arathnim how old are you?
2014-12-09 21:17:56	Arathnim	18
2014-12-09 21:18:01	+brkk	great
2014-12-09 21:18:12	+Jas	did you make any cool ai things? i really just started dabbling with it
2014-12-09 21:20:07	Arathnim	Mostly I used other frameworks, but I wrote a program to try solve the TSP using genetic algorithms, a couple of neural net pattern-recog programs, and probably some others i'm forgetting.
2014-12-09 21:21:25	Arathnim	Nothing really striking yet though.
2014-12-09 21:23:40	+Jas	TSP using genetic algorithms?
2014-12-09 21:23:46	+Jas	how did that work out?
2014-12-09 21:26:02	Arathnim	Sub-optimal at almost every number of cities.  Mainly because there's no way of knowing when your route is the shortest, it just becomes impossible to find a better route.
2014-12-09 21:28:35	Arathnim	It was quite quick to improve the route, reaching 1/4 the distance of a random route within a few hundred generations, but almost always failed to converge.
2014-12-09 21:41:30	Arathnim	brkk: Good video. I'm going to listen to the rest while I read learn you some erlang.
2014-12-09 21:47:33	+Jas	"Artificial intelligence researcher Marco Dorigo described in 1997 a method of heuristically generating "good solutions" to the TSP using a simulation of an ant colony called ACS (Ant Colony System).[26] It models behavior observed in real ants to find short paths between food sources and their nest, an emergent behaviour resulting from each ant's preference to follow trail pheromones deposited by other ants."
2014-12-09 21:49:01	+Jas	"shit i wonder how the ants do it" -> good solutions
2014-12-09 21:49:24	+Jas	AI best subject

2014-12-09 21:51:39	Arathnim	Yup.  If you're not working in Ai, what are you doing with yourself? uni?
2014-12-09 21:51:44	+Jas	yeah uni
2014-12-09 21:51:46	+Jas	economics
2014-12-09 21:51:59	+Jas	i'm partially in it for the game theory
2014-12-09 21:52:24	+Jas	>what are you doing with yourself
2014-12-09 21:52:25	+Jas	pls
2014-12-09 21:52:26	+Jas	i barely know
2014-12-09 21:54:59	Arathnim	Game theory's pretty awesome. And it's pretty close to some Ai concepts, especially in analyzing optimal moves for some games.
2014-12-09 21:55:58	+Jas	yeah, reading about it and some heavy AI-based marketing research is what got me (more) interested in AI i think
2014-12-09 21:56:43	+Jas	specifically the Target stuff where they could tell if a woman was pregnant and give her baby-ads before she even knew it herself

2014-12-16 18:16:11	Danavu	anshin: looked into lambda calculus?
2014-12-16 18:17:58	&anshin	a bit, yeah
2014-12-16 18:18:33	Danavu	i'm attempting to teach myself it, but there's a lot of holes in my math skills
2014-12-16 18:19:56	+dymatic	What would be the way to say "set A is contained inside set B"?
2014-12-16 18:20:04	+dymatic	Mathematically.
2014-12-16 18:20:15	&anshin	I've no idea

2014-12-16 18:21:32	+dymatic	Ah, okay.
2014-12-16 18:22:08	+brkk	if A ⊂ B then A is a subset of B
2014-12-16 18:22:10	+dymatic	Yup. Subset. Thanks.
2014-12-16 18:22:13	+brkk	:3
2014-12-16 18:22:15	+brkk	math is love
2014-12-16 18:22:16	+brkk	math is life
2014-12-16 18:23:00	+dymatic	I don't like math. But Lisp has given me a fetishistic attraction to sets.
2014-12-16 18:23:12	&anshin	I've always loved math, but I never really went past algebra 2
2014-12-16 18:23:17	&anshin	I took a trig class but that was it
2014-12-16 18:23:29	+brkk	^

2014-12-16 18:31:34	+dymatic	I've been trying to find something for a while and can't do it.
2014-12-16 18:31:40	+dymatic	Does anyone watch programmers create things?
2014-12-16 18:31:48	+dymatic	Like, youtube?
2014-12-16 18:31:56	+dymatic	I feel like there could be great code commentators. Notch does an okay job at it.
2014-12-16 18:32:07	&anshin	not really. I've seen a few talks that use creation as a device, but they're really isolated
2014-12-16 18:32:14	Danavu	this is blowin my mind right now https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus#Logic_and_predicates
2014-12-16 18:32:42	&anshin	dymatic: http://worrydream.com/
2014-12-16 18:33:54	&anshin	huh
2014-12-16 18:34:16	&anshin	logic gates in lambda calculus
2014-12-16 18:35:40	Danavu	crazy huh
2014-12-16 18:36:46	+dymatic	>all functions are anonymous in Lambda calculus
2014-12-16 18:36:54	+dymatic	This looks like what would happen if a programmer invented a field of math.
2014-12-16 18:36:59	+dymatic	Not the other way around.
2014-12-16 18:37:11	+dymatic	WAIT
2014-12-16 18:37:14	+dymatic	Disregard that.
2014-12-16 18:37:30	+dymatic	Too tired to think straight. I was interpretting "anonymous" as "lazy", which made no sense when I thought about it.
2014-12-16 18:37:40	&anshin	heh
2014-12-16 18:38:16	+dymatic	It's cool that all functions are anonymous though.
2014-12-16 18:38:34	+dymatic	It would be like everything in a programming language expanding to a macro that's just one big lambda.
2014-12-16 18:38:54	&anshin	yep
2014-12-16 19:10:55	Danavu	dymatic: I think that's called lisp
2014-12-16 19:11:21	+dymatic	I sure wish glutin built.

2015-03-07 11:55:02	+kori	you're 100% right
2015-03-07 11:55:03	@anshin	> In an advertisement campaign by Always, when adult women and men are asked to run/hit/throw like a girl they do those things wispily and terribly. On the other hand, when young girls are asked to run/hit/throw like a girl, they do those things with lots of enthusiasm and effort. When asked what doing things like a girl means to them, a young girl responds “Do them as best as you can.”

2015-03-07 12:02:47	@anshin	but in all seriousness, we're raised up viewing women through a certain lens, like we idealize them or something

2015-03-07 12:10:48	@anshin	kori: literally everything stems from primal instincts to some degree, but that doesn't mean it's the sole factor. women are supposed to reproduce too
2015-03-07 12:12:28	+stallman	they didn't need to seek men in the same way

2015-03-07 12:25:26	@anshin	heh
2015-03-07 12:25:41	lancee	men are considered ugly and disgusting but that is only because people are not familiar with the menstrual cycle and the female genitalia

2015-03-08 13:56:03	brkk_mobile	what's SEP?
2015-03-08 13:56:53	slackR	.g sep
2015-03-08 13:59:30	brkk_mobile	trying lubuntu
2015-03-08 13:59:34	brkk_mobile	it's not this bad
2015-03-08 14:02:20	--	kori is now known as ANTI-NOOB|KORI

2015-03-08 14:03:50	brkk_mobile	oh
2015-03-08 14:05:09	tsune	I definitely do that sometimes
2015-03-08 14:07:56	@anshin	I'm thinking about the perception filter variation
2015-03-08 14:08:04	@anshin	where you basically don't comprehend that something is valuable
2015-03-08 14:08:12	@anshin	this is partly why people just ignore Haskell
2015-03-08 14:08:31	brkk_mobile	the industry's decline
2015-03-08 14:09:28	slackR	anshin: I ignored haskell because of Larry 
2015-03-08 14:09:36	slackR	perl founder 
2015-03-08 14:12:14	@anshin	slackR: how come?
2015-03-08 14:12:39	@anshin	also my notifications are broken
2015-03-08 14:12:45	brkk_mobile	same here
2015-03-08 14:12:57	@anshin	hmm
2015-03-08 14:12:59	@anshin	gonna fix
2015-03-08 14:13:01	+kori	[✔] Same
2015-03-08 14:13:48	@anshin	back, should be fixed
2015-03-08 14:14:43	slackR	anshin: he said haskell is for geniuses 
2015-03-08 14:14:52	@anshin	ah
2015-03-08 14:15:24	brkk_mobile	it's a elitist thought
2015-03-08 14:15:40	@anshin	or self-deprecating
2015-03-08 14:16:11	brkk_mobile	and/or
2015-03-08 14:16:13	brkk_mobile	:3
2015-03-08 14:16:25	@anshin	yep
2015-03-08 14:16:31	brkk_mobile	that's why we cant have nice things
2015-03-08 14:17:32	brkk_mobile	"it's too hard, it's not for me, better learn something else"
2015-03-08 14:17:46	slackR	Oh 
2015-03-08 14:18:00	slackR	That's why I stopped learning cpp
2015-03-08 14:18:09	brkk_mobile	"only neckbeards know haskell"
2015-03-08 14:18:16	brkk_mobile	"never gonna use haskell IRL"
2015-03-08 14:18:33	slackR	I felt it has too many things 
2015-03-08 14:19:07	slackR	Is haskell useful in real life?
2015-03-08 14:19:14	@anshin	uhh
2015-03-08 14:19:28	@anshin	turing completeness means haskell is capable of doing anything any other language can do
2015-03-08 14:19:52	@anshin	the question is, can you use it to build production software with it in efficient dev time
2015-03-08 14:20:00	@anshin	the answer is most likely yes
2015-03-08 14:20:14	@anshin	s/with it//
2015-03-08 14:20:28	slackR	Is it hard?
2015-03-08 14:20:34	@anshin	of course it's hard
2015-03-08 14:20:42	brkk_mobile	it's disruptive
2015-03-08 14:20:43	brkk_mobile	:^)
2015-03-08 14:20:45	@anshin	yeah
2015-03-08 14:20:46	@anshin	exactly
2015-03-08 14:20:57	@anshin	it requires a new way of thinking, and that's very difficult to do
2015-03-08 14:21:04	brkk_mobile	very very
2015-03-08 14:21:17	@anshin	but that doesn't mean it's not worth it
2015-03-08 14:21:28	@anshin	actually it may mean it's *more* worth it
2015-03-08 14:21:38	brkk_mobile	anshin you ARE me
2015-03-08 14:21:41	@anshin	even if you never use haskell for production, it'll change the way you think about programming
2015-03-08 14:22:02	slackR	Oh 
2015-03-08 14:22:07	slackR	What about lisp
2015-03-08 14:22:14	@anshin	second verse same as the first
2015-03-08 14:23:13	slackR	So I'll add haskell in my to learn list 
2015-03-08 14:23:28	brkk_mobile	tfw need to learn scheme for a `scientific initiation`
2015-03-08 14:23:39	brkk_mobile	dunno how do you call it in USA

2015-03-08 14:25:26	slackR	I don't know how metaprogramming works 
2015-03-08 14:25:42	@anshin	I think it's just preprocessing
2015-03-08 14:26:26	slackR	Also I have no idea how a software is made 
2015-03-08 14:26:29	@anshin	have you used #define in C?
2015-03-08 14:26:46	slackR	I know only cpp
2015-03-08 14:26:57	@anshin	C++'s #define is probably the same
2015-03-08 14:27:02	◥	tsune (~enrique@Rizon-E1C949E4.dyn.user.ono.com) has joined #code
2015-03-08 14:27:07	@anshin	at its simplest, metaprogramming is just substitution
2015-03-08 14:28:10	slackR	#define is used when we bring other class right 
2015-03-08 14:28:15	slackR	External one
2015-03-08 14:28:27	slackR	:(
2015-03-08 14:28:32	@anshin	> #define SUPER XCB_MOD_MASK_4
2015-03-08 14:28:49	@anshin	this just replaces all instances of SUPER with XCB_MOD_MASK_4 at compile time
2015-03-08 14:29:10	slackR	Uh. 
2015-03-08 14:29:33	slackR	Anshin how are gui made
2015-03-08 14:29:35	@anshin	could also be #define lol LOLLL
2015-03-08 14:30:02	slackR	Using qt? 
2015-03-08 14:30:06	@anshin	no idea
2015-03-08 14:30:15	kyubiko	You could use any toolkit you want
2015-03-08 14:30:16	@anshin	I have a vague idea of it but I never really do it
2015-03-08 14:30:19	@anshin	Qt is one
2015-03-08 14:30:23	kyubiko	you could be mad a write directly to the framebuffer
2015-03-08 14:30:25	@anshin	GTK is another way
2015-03-08 14:30:31	kyubiko	literally anyway is possibl
2015-03-08 14:30:32	kyubiko	e
2015-03-08 14:30:50	slackR	U never made a gui software? 
2015-03-08 14:31:34	@anshin	not since I was using windows in like 2009
2015-03-08 14:31:38	kyubiko	"Gui software" isn't really different from any other software

2015-03-08 14:32:36	slackR	Till now I have never written a program in cpp which is more than 100 lines 
2015-03-08 14:32:56	@anshin	I've probably never made anything more than a thousand lines
2015-03-08 14:33:02	slackR	I don't know how to send requests to system
2015-03-08 14:33:17	@anshin	depends on what kind of requests and what kind of system
2015-03-08 14:33:26	slackR	Oh 
2015-03-08 14:33:34	tsune	if it's just a command call there has to be an import / package to doi t
2015-03-08 14:33:36	tsune	do it*
2015-03-08 14:34:11	slackR	Do I need to know the working of the os in order to
2015-03-08 14:34:13	slackR	Do it 
2015-03-08 14:34:15	slackR	??? 
2015-03-08 14:34:29	tsune	if it's what i said, nope
2015-03-08 14:34:31	@anshin	usually no, still depends
2015-03-08 14:34:40	tsune	in golang for example it'd be
2015-03-08 14:34:44	tsune	import "os"
2015-03-08 14:34:56	tsune	os.Exec("echo", "hello")
2015-03-08 14:35:08	slackR	tsune: what it does 
2015-03-08 14:35:27	tsune	just echoes hello through stdout
2015-03-08 14:35:32	tsune	but you could run whatever with that
2015-03-08 14:35:38	tsune	it just makes a call to the system to run the echo command
2015-03-08 14:36:17	slackR	Oh 
2015-03-08 14:36:38	slackR	So I need to know which and all header files 
2015-03-08 14:36:42	slackR	I need to use 
2015-03-08 14:36:46	slackR	In my software 
2015-03-08 14:37:04	slackR	How will I know that 
2015-03-08 14:37:13	slackR	Cpp has many 
2015-03-08 14:37:18	slackR	It's bloated 
2015-03-08 14:37:22	tsune	You figure it out on the way
2015-03-08 14:37:25	tsune	it's like
2015-03-08 14:37:28	tsune	oh i need to do regex work
2015-03-08 14:37:32	tsune	import "regexp"
2015-03-08 14:37:38	tsune	there's not a lot behind it
2015-03-08 14:37:53	slackR	Oh. 
2015-03-08 14:38:12	@anshin	mostly memorization yeah
2015-03-08 14:39:05	slackR	Ohkay 
2015-03-08 14:39:37	slackR	Memory allocation is hard for me, I don't know why 
2015-03-08 14:39:49	tsune	what is it you don't get of Mem allocation?
2015-03-08 14:40:01	tsune	I haven't done it in C++ but I've used it in C, i don't know if it's changed a lot
2015-03-08 14:41:14	slackR	Oh 
2015-03-08 14:41:32	slackR	I was planning to abondon cpp
2015-03-08 14:41:55	slackR	I have to learn c one way or other 
2015-03-08 14:42:06	slackR	Cause embedded programming 
2015-03-08 14:42:17	tsune	oh yeah
2015-03-08 14:42:22	slackR	Cpp embedded programming is nightmare 
2015-03-08 14:42:25	@dymatic	I can help a bit with memory management.
2015-03-08 14:42:46	slackR	dymatic: thanks.  I'll ask when in doubt. 
2015-03-08 14:43:03	@dymatic	I use Rust which checks for memory errors at compile-time like it would for type errors.
2015-03-08 14:43:27	@dymatic	free(x); y = x+1; would be as bad as (double x; char c; y = x / c)
2015-03-08 14:43:27	slackR	Also cpt_yossarian is making a post about it so I'll learn from there. 
2015-03-08 14:43:43	slackR	And if I have any doubt I'll ask here 
2015-03-08 14:44:18	slackR	dymatic: that code is sick
2015-03-08 14:44:26	slackR	Ugh
2015-03-08 14:44:31	@dymatic	What code's sick?
2015-03-08 14:44:49	slackR	double x; char c; y = x / c
2015-03-08 14:44:53	@dymatic	Oh, you meant sick as in not good.
2015-03-08 14:44:59	slackR	Yeah 
2015-03-08 14:45:13	slackR	Not as in saying 
2015-03-08 14:45:50	@anshin	english is hilarious
2015-03-08 14:46:32	@dymatic	Well, did an hour of real parkour, hour of fake.

2015-03-08 15:41:28	+stallman	how about

2015-03-08 15:42:01	+stallman	o cool
2015-03-08 15:42:02	@dymatic	I have the same gripe with libre that everyone else does.
2015-03-08 15:42:03	+stallman	i'm voiced
2015-03-08 15:42:06	+stallman	since when was i voiced
2015-03-08 15:42:12	@dymatic	The UI is STRAIGHT outa 1999.
2015-03-08 15:42:23	+kori	no really I want a newer name
2015-03-08 15:42:29	+stallman	dymatic: kind of
2015-03-08 15:42:30	@dymatic	And there's no reason for that. There are good looking libre apps.
2015-03-08 15:42:42	+stallman	i don't really have a problem with its ui though
2015-03-08 15:42:50	+stallman	i mean it works still and is incredibly obvious to use
2015-03-08 15:42:59	+stallman	the icons don't look terrible or anything
2015-03-08 15:43:05	@dymatic	I don't have a problem with it. It's usable, which I guess is what matters. But it's no Ribbon.
2015-03-08 15:43:10	+stallman	MS couldn't really make up their mind w/ ribbon
2015-03-08 15:43:12	@dymatic	Which a lot of people are just used to by now.
2015-03-08 15:43:29	+stallman	my dad and his coworkers always found ribbon annoying too
2015-03-08 15:43:37	+stallman	the people that can adjust easily could probably adjust to libre's
2015-03-08 15:43:57	+stallman	EITHER WAY it wouldn't hurt
2015-03-08 15:44:05	+stallman	they can and are doing some UX shit apparently
2015-03-08 15:44:09	@dymatic	I don't disagree. Libre's... I can't put a finger on it.
2015-03-08 15:44:14	@dymatic	It lacks character.
2015-03-08 15:44:24	+stallman	pizzaz
2015-03-08 15:44:34	@dymatic	I could mock up a similar UI in Glade.
2015-03-08 15:44:37	@dymatic	Yeah. Pizzaz.
2015-03-08 15:44:54	+stallman	although if they radically changed it we'd probably have more people bitching too
2015-03-08 15:45:03	+stallman	firefox couldn't even improve their UI without tons of people bitching
2015-03-08 15:45:05	+stallman	before it even happened
2015-03-08 15:45:18	+stallman	although good thing they did it anyway cause it's a lot better than before
2015-03-08 15:45:30	@dymatic	Because the people who saw it early are the people who dislike all that flair.
2015-03-08 15:45:38	+stallman	ye true
2015-03-08 15:45:42	@dymatic	I've always liked Australis.
2015-03-08 15:45:44	@anshin	same
2015-03-08 15:45:47	+stallman	me too
2015-03-08 15:45:56	+stallman	it didn't change anything i could do with the browser
2015-03-08 15:46:01	+stallman	and made it more appealing to noobs
2015-03-08 15:46:12	+stallman	as well as being easier to use anyway
2015-03-08 15:46:17	@anshin	I actually explicitly got the UX branch of FF very early, before it was ever moved into nightly
2015-03-08 15:46:34	@anshin	FF has always looked awful on linux
2015-03-08 15:47:02	+stallman	it certainly looks a lot better now than it did before though
2015-03-08 15:47:04	+stallman	especially on gnome shell
2015-03-08 15:47:09	+stallman	looks almost native
2015-03-08 15:47:09	@anshin	yeah I love australis
2015-03-08 15:47:23	+stallman	before shit stuck out like a sore thumb, now it at least fits
2015-03-08 15:47:30	@anshin	it looked better when I wasn't using eOS but it's still great
2015-03-08 15:47:32	+stallman	even on ubuntu's ugly default theme
2015-03-08 15:48:11	+stallman	firefox 4 looked pretty bad lol
2015-03-08 15:48:12	+stallman	even on windows 
2015-03-08 15:48:17	+stallman	the button was just so out of place and weird
2015-03-08 15:48:32	+kori	been a while since I've heard the term australis
2015-03-08 15:48:36	@anshin	FF has never been great with design
2015-03-08 15:48:41	+kori	it still angers me but not so much anymore, I don't have to deal with it :3
2015-03-08 15:48:59	+stallman	i use vimperator and i've never had to deal w/ it @ least
2015-03-08 15:49:02	@anshin	australis isn't that hard to rice ur just noobs
2015-03-08 15:49:13	@anshin	I prefer vimfx
2015-03-08 15:49:15	@anshin	doesn't modify UI
2015-03-08 15:49:19	+kori	if twily didn't help me I would have been so fugged
2015-03-08 15:49:26	+stallman	i haven't tried it yet, is vimfx faster anshin ?
2015-03-08 15:49:32	@dymatic	I prefer Chrome out of sheer laziness.
2015-03-08 15:49:35	@anshin	I haven't used vimperator in depth
2015-03-08 15:49:57	@anshin	I'm probably going to use chromium a bit for webdev because Facebook's fb-flo is chromium onl
2015-03-08 15:49:59	@anshin	only*
2015-03-08 15:50:23	+stallman	the only thing i liked more about chromium is that its web dev stuff is faster
2015-03-08 15:50:29	+stallman	and this comp is rly slow
2015-03-08 15:50:34	+stallman	but i don't use it for anything else
2015-03-08 15:51:06	@dymatic	I'm going to reveal my age a lot with the next sentence.
2015-03-08 15:51:14	@dymatic	Chrome was the first program I ever installed myself.
2015-03-08 15:51:25	@dymatic	I hot my history and cloud stuff all synced up with it first. Moving would be a pain by now.
2015-03-08 15:51:58	@anshin	but what about ur privacy
2015-03-08 15:52:34	@dymatic	Actually curious or trollin?
2015-03-08 15:52:39	@anshin	the latter
2015-03-08 15:52:42	@anshin	I recall your position
2015-03-08 15:52:53	+kori	I need something that would let me use commands like :o and such
2015-03-08 15:52:59	+kori	something that isn't vimperator
2015-03-08 15:53:01	@anshin	I still don't like it but I have too much respect for you to repeat that conversation every time it comes up
2015-03-08 15:53:03	+kori	vimperator is too aggressive
2015-03-08 15:53:18	@dymatic	It's fine. I admit that I'm wrong.
2015-03-08 15:53:27	+kori	but its pretty much my only option
2015-03-08 15:53:49	@dymatic	People have the right to individual privacy. But we should have the right to abandon it, and that's where I am.
2015-03-08 15:53:58	@anshin	I think privacy is among the top concerns of our entire generation and your stance is basically that you don't want to be part of the struggle
2015-03-08 15:54:00	@anshin	and I get that
2015-03-08 15:54:16	@anshin	kori: what's `:o`?
2015-03-08 15:54:30	+kori	open
2015-03-08 15:54:38	+kori	open URL for example
2015-03-08 15:54:40	+kori	:o google.com
2015-03-08 15:54:41	@anshin	does it open in the current tab or a new one?
2015-03-08 15:54:44	+kori	current
2015-03-08 15:54:48	+kori	:tabopen is new tab
2015-03-08 15:54:58	@dymatic	:nt google.com would be nice.
2015-03-08 15:55:02	+kori	but you can just press "o" or "t" and it'd open the command line thing with ":open" or ":tabopen"
2015-03-08 15:55:24	@anshin	`o` focuses the location bar in vimfx and `t` opens a new tab with the location bar selected
2015-03-08 15:55:36	+kori	I don't have the location bar, so vimfx is useless to me
2015-03-08 15:55:46	+kori	I remove every element of the UI but the tabs
2015-03-08 15:55:46	@anshin	seriously??
2015-03-08 15:55:53	+kori	yeah
2015-03-08 15:55:54	@anshin	what do you use instead?
2015-03-08 15:55:59	+kori	vimperator's bar was enough 
2015-03-08 15:56:03	@anshin	ah
2015-03-08 15:56:04	+kori	https://u.teknik.io/AH234M.png
2015-03-08 15:56:08	+kori	here's pentadactyl
2015-03-08 15:56:12	+kori	after pressing 't'
2015-03-08 15:56:23	@anshin	> google
2015-03-08 15:56:27	+kori	but I could just press : and it'd open the same command line without commands
2015-03-08 15:56:38	@anshin	huh
2015-03-08 15:56:39	+kori	anshin: I use startpage 90% of the time
2015-03-08 15:56:43	@anshin	isn't pentadactyl dead?
2015-03-08 15:56:48	+kori	no
2015-03-08 15:56:50	+kori	nightly builds
2015-03-08 15:57:07	+kori	it has more active development than vimperator iirc
2015-03-08 15:57:11	@anshin	huh
2015-03-08 15:57:13	@anshin	it WAS dead
2015-03-08 15:57:15	+kori	anshin: after pressing : https://u.teknik.io/Y6IJbu.png
2015-03-08 15:57:20	+kori	it behaves pretty much exactly like vim
2015-03-08 15:58:20	@anshin	ehhh
2015-03-08 15:58:41	+kori	I'm going to start using pentadactyl again
2015-03-08 15:58:44	@anshin	it occurs to me more often nowadays that in other circumstances dissenters would just be killed
2015-03-08 15:59:05	@anshin	like lots of the great revolutionaries were executed
2015-03-08 15:59:28	@anshin	privacy is a threat to the state, so that makes privacy advocates targets
2015-03-08 15:59:31	@anshin	it's really eerie
2015-03-08 16:00:58	+stallman	kori: you can re-enable the GUI with vimperator though
2015-03-08 16:01:01	+stallman	pentadactyl is shitty
2015-03-08 16:01:12	+stallman	it's really slow on this machine 
2015-03-08 16:01:21	+stallman	vimperator is a lot more efficient
2015-03-08 16:01:25	+kori	stallman: shrug
2015-03-08 16:01:28	+kori	dunno
2015-03-08 16:03:35	+stallman	dymatic: you can make a shortcut for :nt
2015-03-08 16:03:44	+stallman	but by default in vimperator, just pressing t is newtab
2015-03-08 16:03:50	+stallman	sorry, tabopen
2015-03-08 16:04:14	+stallman	typing "tgoogle.com\n" will open a new tab
2015-03-08 16:04:32	+kori	woah pentadactyl can be way prettier than vimperator
2015-03-08 16:07:07	+kori	it renders fonts correctly

2015-11-05 22:35:06	dymatic	1 annotiation per fucking line? How is he even going to grade all that
2015-11-05 22:35:24	+nv	she literally just looks at it for one second and makes up a random grade
2015-11-05 22:35:55	+nv	but she refuses to give 100 on it. like some fag had the entire page just covered in pencil/pen/highlighter to the point where you could no longer read the original text
2015-11-05 22:36:00	+nv	and she gave him a fucking 95
2015-11-05 22:36:38	dymatic	That's how teachers roll. They feel like 100 shows a problem on their part for not grading hard enough.
2015-11-05 22:36:40	dymatic	What level is this?
2015-11-05 22:37:05	+nv	hs literature ~ it's an honors course but honors literature tends to be a joke
2015-11-05 22:37:18	spoonm	that sucks
2015-11-05 22:37:25	dymatic	HS? Why are you trying?
2015-11-05 22:37:37	dymatic	Scrape by with barely enough to get into college.
2015-11-05 22:37:44	+nv	because i believe that if i try hard enough i might be able to get into MIT by some miracle
2015-11-05 22:37:49	dymatic	College is what... actually, nobody cares about. Job experience is where it's at.
2015-11-05 22:38:15	dymatic	And MIT may be more focused on portfolio. They reject valedictorians if their portfolios aren't falling apart at the seams.
2015-11-05 22:38:32	+nv	yeah im trying to work on both honestly
2015-11-05 22:39:21	+nv	i don't know how impressive the other applicants are but im hoping i may be able to get in if i do something interesting with CS
2015-11-05 22:39:39	dymatic	Being incredibly focuses helps.
2015-11-05 22:39:43	dymatic	focused*
2015-11-05 22:39:49	+nv	ya well im not, at all
2015-11-05 22:39:53	dymatic	They want people who will leave their school and become artisans in their field.
2015-11-05 22:40:01	dymatic	So, if you're THE database motherfucker, you're in.
2015-11-05 22:40:37	dymatic	Or if you're girlfriend is an AI you programmed yourself, in.
2015-11-05 22:41:05	+nv	i really want to do something with type theory if i can find a decent introductory text
2015-11-05 22:41:24	+nv	but i wouldnt be surprised if that requires self-studying like half of the available college-level math courses
2015-11-05 22:41:29	dymatic	You use Haskell, right?
2015-11-05 22:41:39	+nv	sometimes but it's not my first language of choice
2015-11-05 22:41:45	dymatic	Use it as such.
2015-11-05 22:41:54	dymatic	A background in Haskell OR a background in math gets you set up for type theory.
2015-11-05 22:42:29	+nv	im really hoping that i can convince GA tech to allow me to study a discrete math course there before the end of high school
2015-11-05 22:42:49	dymatic	nv, have you done calculus?
2015-11-05 22:43:04	+nv	im doing calc I this year and hopefully i get to study calc II @ ga tech next year
2015-11-05 22:43:29	dymatic	Calc II
2015-11-05 22:43:31	dymatic	Will open
2015-11-05 22:43:33	dymatic	your fucking
2015-11-05 22:43:35	dymatic	rectum
2015-11-05 22:43:52	dymatic	Calc I is like arithmetic compared to it in terms of shit you need to memorize.
2015-11-05 22:43:59	dymatic	But after Calc I you'll have the background for discrete.
2015-11-05 22:44:52	+nv	yeah we've done a tiny bit of discrete math so far but not enough to really be useful at this point

2015-11-05 22:50:49	dymatic	What kind of fucking sorcery?
2015-11-05 22:51:14	+nv	what the hell is that a 3d array of chars?
2015-11-05 22:51:27	+nv	where the fuck would you possibly need that kind of data structure?
2015-11-05 22:51:36	dymatic	nv, I'm wrapping my head around it atm
2015-11-05 22:51:42	dymatic	It parses a file where lines are split up like this
2015-11-05 22:51:48	dymatic	|I am a section| |I am a section|
2015-11-05 22:52:01	dymatic	So each line is string[]
2015-11-05 22:52:12	+nv	so first array = file, second array = line, third array = chars of string?
2015-11-05 22:52:15	dymatic	Making string[][]. i.e, car[][][]
2015-11-05 22:52:53	+nv	i feel like there's got to be a more elegant solution to this
2015-11-05 22:53:21	dymatic	Yeah. Working on that. For what it's solving, it's actually pretty well designed.
2015-11-05 22:59:35	dymatic	Guys ohmyfuckinggod
2015-11-05 22:59:39	dymatic	Black Ops 3 in 1 hour.
2015-11-05 23:11:23	+nv	dymatic: you're mainly a .NET guy right? do you have any idea how i can easily edit excel spreadsheets with the .NET api or some decent .NET library for it?\
2015-11-05 23:11:52	dymatic	I have no clue about .NET. I use C# on Linux.
2015-11-05 23:12:10	dymatic	I know people usually do VBA, but idk if that ties into .NET closely.
2015-11-05 23:12:20	+nv	oh lol. i have to do this fucking shit for windows for a competition my teacher is making me do
2015-11-05 23:12:39	dymatic	What kind of competition? Do you think you can crush at it?
2015-11-05 23:12:41	+nv	it's fucking retarded because it has to run on XP and i have no idea if my code even will cause i dont own a god damn XP computer
2015-11-05 23:12:55	dymatic	So torrent an XP VM. They're all over the place.
2015-11-05 23:13:00	+nv	it's a state-wide thing but i dont think anyone decent will compete
2015-11-05 23:13:26	dymatic	Interesting. What organization?
2015-11-05 23:13:29	dymatic	FBLA by any chance?
2015-11-05 23:13:34	+nv	yes spot on m8
2015-11-05 23:13:41	dymatic	I won that.
2015-11-05 23:14:03	dymatic	I got arrested before our program went to nationals. Even without a presentation it was called 10th best in the country. We would've fucking swept.
2015-11-05 23:14:06	+nv	is there something above a state level? i've never really payed any attention to this shit
2015-11-05 23:14:26	dymatic	nv, put a bunch of effort into it. There are nationals. They'll fly you out to Chicago, and top prize is like 3,000 bucks.
2015-11-05 23:15:01	+nv	well i have like less than a week till the soft deadline (idk why they have multiple deadlines at all tbh)
2015-11-05 23:15:19	+nv	i've done the backend for this shit but i really don't want to do the UI for it and all
2015-11-05 23:15:38	+nv	and i'm not going to have any time over the weekend or monday and tuesday which fucking sucks
2015-11-05 23:15:46	dymatic	Which one are you doing? Desktop app or game?
2015-11-05 23:15:52	@kori	hi Naughtsee 
2015-11-05 23:16:25	+nv	im doing the desktop app one. the project is like a database for student information with a pretty frontend to format it as a report (has to be in 3 formats)
2015-11-05 23:16:46	dymatic	Oh man, you could do some fancy shit with that.
2015-11-05 23:16:58	+nv	im thinking of just generating LaTeX if i can find a good way to compile it inside my program and knocking out 2/3 at once
2015-11-05 23:17:25	dymatic	Do you have any DB experience?
2015-11-05 23:17:29	+nv	gotta say picking a .NET language was pretty smart in the long run because LINQ made it easy as shit
2015-11-05 23:17:54	+nv	no but as per the requirements it has to be some kind of human readable file so i threw together a simple JSON serialization thing
2015-11-05 23:17:55	dymatic	LINQ is mind bogglingly useful. .NET in general has a lot of nice conveniences. Like null coalescing.
2015-11-05 23:18:26	+nv	oh speaking of which i really need to do an installer just to create the database correctly
2015-11-05 23:18:42	dymatic	Yeah. The Installer is what kinda fucked our team a little bit.
2015-11-05 23:19:20	+nv	i mean i could just do it as part of the code (check if shit's installed correctly, if not just setup the dir hierarchy and drop in the files that are needed)
2015-11-05 23:19:31	+nv	but i think using an installer would be easier
2015-11-05 23:19:40	dymatic	The code should still check.
2015-11-05 23:21:29	@kori	https://lobste.rs/s/uyjrjb/firefox_moving_native_pocket_integration_to_an_add-on
2015-11-05 23:21:32	@kori	excellent
2015-11-05 23:24:10	+nv	okay what the fuck im getting ads on youtube again and this time uBlock is enabled
2015-11-05 23:24:59	@kori	nv: which
2015-11-05 23:25:14	@kori	if it's not ublock origin you just got coaxed into a snafu
2015-11-05 23:25:27	+nv	kori: im using origin on here
2015-11-05 23:27:01	@kori	https://lobste.rs/s/06bklb/programmers_stop_calling_yourselves_engineers/comments/75zmzw#c_75zmzw
2015-11-05 23:28:11	+nv	so anyways, programmatically generating LaTeX is probably the easiest way to format the data from the DB for viewing as a PDF and printing, right?
2015-11-05 23:28:40	dymatic	You are going to have a hard time with that I think.
2015-11-05 23:28:53	dymatic	Programmtically generating a turing-complete language is... literally writing a compiler.
2015-11-05 23:29:11	dymatic	If you're familiar with parser generators and stuff, then sure.
2015-11-05 23:29:30	+nv	well i mean i have the data in a really predictable format so it would just be formatting it as a table
2015-11-05 23:30:32	@kori	http://web.archive.org/web/20151013161308/http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/
2015-11-05 23:30:35	dymatic	True.
2015-11-05 23:30:36	@kori	btw that's the old guile website
2015-11-05 23:30:40	+nv	basically just a format that's [First Name] [Last Name] [Email] for a shit ton of rows
2015-11-05 23:30:48	dymatic	kori, isn't the new one so sexy?
2015-11-05 23:30:55	+nv	LaTeX may be completely overkill here though
2015-11-05 23:31:00	@kori	dymatic: yeah dude it got posted on hn
2015-11-05 23:31:06	@kori	and it got 171 upboats
2015-11-05 23:31:11	@kori	damn I wish I could have thought of that
2015-11-05 23:31:13	+nv	oh wait no i need to print out the other data too
2015-11-05 23:31:54	+nv	which is [Membership #] [First Name] [Last Name] [Year Joined] [Grade] [$ Owed] for the first table
2015-11-05 23:32:08	+nv	followed by a list of which of those members are active/inactive
2015-11-05 23:32:39	+nv	and a bit of extra data at the bottom (number of members who owe money, how much is owed in total, avg amount owed, etc.)
2015-11-05 23:32:44	dymatic	Persoanlly, I'd parse those into an internal data structure and make my own painter to render those in a pretter format.
2015-11-05 23:33:10	+nv	well i need to display visually but then i need to be able to make them printable too
2015-11-05 23:33:31	+nv	and on top of that i've got to make the one that's just a table export to an excel spreadsheet
2015-11-05 23:33:42	dymatic	The internal data structure would still handle that.
2015-11-05 23:33:54	+nv	i dont want to think about how to print shit out myself tbh fam
2015-11-05 23:34:26	dymatic	What language is all of this in again?
2015-11-05 23:34:46	dymatic	If it's in an OO lang just override toString and iteratively print all the DS's.
2015-11-05 23:34:47	+nv	im using F# but it's still small enough to be translated to C# reasonably
2015-11-05 23:35:10	dymatic	Oh my god. F#. Is that going to be okay with a GUI?
2015-11-05 23:35:26	+nv	im not sure but the GUI doesn't seem to awful to do so far
2015-11-05 23:35:46	dymatic	I like F# personally. But a lot of F# features are in C# too. It's all preference.
2015-11-05 23:35:54	+nv	it's just a screen with 4 options - insert record, update record, export report 1, export report 2
2015-11-05 23:36:37	+nv	what about markdown? does that seem reasonable?
2015-11-05 23:36:50	dymatic	For dispaly?
2015-11-05 23:36:56	+nv	for printing i guess
2015-11-05 23:37:07	dymatic	Hmmm. IDK the specs for the project.
2015-11-05 23:37:23	+nv	i can find them and put it in a paste bin hold on
2015-11-05 23:37:24	dymatic	For just straight up pritning, that does seem reasonable though. Markdown looks pretty as plaintext.
2015-11-05 23:45:21	+nv	here is the specs i could find for it https://paste.teknik.io/2332
2015-11-05 23:45:23	@kori	http://www.garlikov.com/Soc_Meth.html
2015-11-05 23:45:49	+nv	i found the way they judged it like 4 years ago too but im not sure if it's going to be the same
2015-11-05 23:46:50	+nv	a good portion of it is on code readability so i really hope these niggers know F#
2015-11-05 23:47:13	dymatic	Commment the everliving fuck out of everything.
2015-11-05 23:47:15	dymatic	They love that.
2015-11-05 23:47:29	+nv	yes lol ik. what's nice is that, for the most part, F# reads like english
2015-11-05 23:47:51	@kori	are you doing the competition thing again
2015-11-05 23:48:13	+nv	yes kori 
2015-11-05 23:48:53	@kori	simple solution: write the program first in F#
2015-11-05 23:49:08	@kori	and then translate to their language of preference
2015-11-05 23:49:19	dymatic	Thier language of prefrence is most liekly Java.
2015-11-05 23:49:24	dymatic	Fuck I fucked about every word there.
2015-11-05 23:49:31	@kori	so when and if they don't accept the F# version you just whip out the other version and go
2015-11-05 23:49:33	@kori	"HA"
2015-11-05 23:51:19	@kori	oh man
2015-11-05 23:51:25	+nv	god damn i would kill myself if i had to use java
2015-11-05 23:51:30	@kori	due to the automatic replace thing I hadn't seen "coder" for so long

2015-11-06 19:44:58	@ajimu	I changed the way I type, got a better keyboard
2015-11-06 19:45:07	@ajimu	I do exercises to keep my tendons chill
2015-11-06 19:45:11	Naughtsee	studying @ a uni. major is political science rn. thinking of changing to philosophy for extra unemployment.
2015-11-06 19:45:17	Naughtsee	Ah so it's like carpal tunnel but more hardcore
2015-11-06 19:45:18	@ajimu	nice choice
2015-11-06 19:45:21	Naughtsee	ty 1
2015-11-06 19:45:25	Naughtsee	s/1/!/
2015-11-06 19:45:35	@ajimu	it's tendonitis, maybe a bit of carpel tunnel too but not sure
2015-11-06 19:45:41	@ajimu	basically painful inflamed tendons a lot
2015-11-06 19:46:23	@ajimu	I also just installed arch after a less than great experience with ubuntu
2015-11-06 19:46:36	@ajimu	which is why I was gone for the past few days, was doing backups/repairs
2015-11-06 19:46:39	Naughtsee	I too installed arch! Why was ubuntu painful?
2015-11-06 19:47:11	@ajimu	my dpkg/apt kept getting locked up for unknown reasons
2015-11-06 19:47:41	@ajimu	also every time I unplugged my keyboard, the setxkbmap stuff was undone/reset and I had to run the command again
2015-11-06 19:48:23	@ajimu	I also couldn't get lightdm to stop starting automatically
2015-11-06 19:48:50	Naughtsee	ubuntu mnml may have been bettr
2015-11-06 19:49:32	vitimiti	systemctl disable lightdm.service
2015-11-06 19:49:35	@ajimu	I tried it initially but I had grub issues
2015-11-06 19:49:39	@ajimu	vitimiti: I did that, several times
2015-11-06 19:49:46	vitimiti	Oh, wait, on Ubuntu
2015-11-06 19:49:48	@ajimu	along with various other whacky attempts
2015-11-06 19:49:50	@ajimu	yeah
2015-11-06 19:50:00	vitimiti	You shouldn't touch Ubuntu's core thingies, it starts misbehaving
2015-11-06 19:50:03	@ajimu	I tried creating an override file for the service and a lot of other stuff
2015-11-06 19:50:06	@ajimu	yeah apparently
2015-11-06 19:50:15	@ajimu	my experience with ubuntu has always been that once I begin tinkering, it starts to decay
2015-11-06 19:50:22	@ajimu	this time, the decay was pretty much immediate and I jumped ship
2015-11-06 19:50:34	vitimiti	You can change the appearance of lightdm, though...
2015-11-06 19:50:58	vitimiti	I like it to have the default looks, though, but I wouldn't recommend Ubuntu for tinkering
2015-11-06 19:51:03	vitimiti	With the system*
2015-11-06 19:51:32	@ajimu	I just wanted to free up resources and close out unity and such
2015-11-06 19:51:59	vitimiti	For that, it's better to install some Ubuntu flavor like Xubuntu or Ubuntu Mate
2015-11-06 19:52:16	Naughtsee	or debian
2015-11-06 19:52:43	kurt_vile	never *buntu
2015-11-06 19:52:45	kurt_vile	always debian
2015-11-06 19:52:45	@ajimu	I chose ubuntu for ppas
2015-11-06 19:52:49	kurt_vile	fuck ppas
2015-11-06 19:52:51	kurt_vile	checkinstall
2015-11-06 19:52:52	@kori	fucking viminfo
2015-11-06 19:52:54	@ajimu	I really hate debian
2015-11-06 19:53:02	kurt_vile	debian is superior
2015-11-06 19:53:08	@ajimu	superior at being awful maybe
2015-11-06 19:53:10	kurt_vile	no
2015-11-06 19:53:15	kurt_vile	superior at having QA
2015-11-06 19:53:22	kurt_vile	superior at being organized 
2015-11-06 19:53:24	@kori	TIL about :read
2015-11-06 19:53:26	kurt_vile	:)
2015-11-06 19:53:30	@kori	maybe ncurses is fine.
2015-11-06 19:53:41	@ajimu	TUIs are good in general
2015-11-06 19:53:46	@ajimu	debian has its upsides and I'd probably be ok if I used sid or something
2015-11-06 19:53:55	@ajimu	at the moment I definitely prefer arch
2015-11-06 19:54:11	kurt_vile	i use sid
2015-11-06 19:54:13	@ajimu	but I've only been back on arch for a few hours so I may not remember why I left for a few more days/weeks
2015-11-06 19:54:15	kurt_vile	and i contribute to debian 
2015-11-06 19:54:21	kurt_vile	so i'm kind of biased
2015-11-06 19:54:27	kurt_vile	but debian is a lot less lazy than arch
2015-11-06 19:54:40	@ajimu	if I were using debian, I would have to write a lot of software for it
2015-11-06 19:54:44	kurt_vile	and the AUR is a crapshow
2015-11-06 19:54:47	@ajimu	to be comfortable
2015-11-06 19:54:52	kurt_vile	ajimu: or learn to use debian's :P
2015-11-06 19:55:02	@ajimu	aur has its issues but ppas and aur are both very good ideas
2015-11-06 19:55:14	@ajimu	that's crazy talk!
2015-11-06 19:55:17	@kori	time to CELEBRATE I guess
2015-11-06 19:55:26	Naughtsee	Man arch is the best!

2015-11-06 20:19:19	@kori	jc
2015-11-06 20:19:31	vitimiti	There are many people in the Arch community that will consider you a heretic for use pulse instead of alsamixer
2015-11-06 20:19:33	@kori	I'm kind of in love with the idea of musl
2015-11-06 20:19:43	@kori	ajimu: alsamixer is the easiest way to demonstrate box drawing chars

2015-11-06 21:55:19	vitimiti	heh
2015-11-06 21:55:34	@ajimu	and history, things I found/read/saved

2015-11-06 21:56:17	@ajimu	I have no idea how that dude was able to function
2015-11-06 21:56:38	@ajimu	and I didn't realize until I read back over the logs
2015-11-06 21:56:40	vitimiti	lol
2015-11-06 21:57:11	@ajimu	he used a japanese/english hybrid at all times and called his mother okaa-san or whatever

2016-09-28 15:19:01	+trinary	Oh dear, they're compiling Rust to JS. This shouldn't be necessary... :'(
2016-09-28 15:19:33	+kori	rustscript when
2016-09-28 15:19:47	+bdelloid	trinary, are they even using emscripten?
2016-09-28 15:19:50	+naughtsee	Hey actual code-ish questions. Any of you running bspwm with two monitors?
2016-09-28 15:20:43	+trinary	bdelloid - Not all do, there's also https://github.com/ticki/cyano .
2016-09-28 15:21:04	+trinary	But yes, emscripten is also used.
2016-09-28 15:21:19	+bdelloid	why would anyone want to use Rust in the browser
2016-09-28 15:21:58	+trinary	If you have an existing game in Rust, and want to run it in the browser... maybe this idea isn't terrible.
2016-09-28 15:22:47	+kori	naughtsee: no but can prob. answer
2016-09-28 15:22:49	+kori	what do you need
2016-09-28 15:22:51	+bdelloid	sounds dumb
2016-09-28 15:23:11	+trinary	bdelloid - How so?
2016-09-28 15:26:04	+bdelloid	I just find the concept of games running in the browser pants on head retarded, and I'm skeptical even emscripten would end up handling glium or the like properly
2016-09-28 15:32:10	+trinary	Some WebGL games run quite well actually. Maybe not quite as efficiently as a native application, but with sandboxing, more cross-platform and without installation. Examples: http://people.mozilla.org/~vladimir/misc/bench-new/ , http://www.hellorun.helloenjoy.com/
2016-09-28 15:35:20	+bdelloid	trinary, I don't doubt that, but glium for instance is very abstracted and handles a lot of stuff in peculiar ways
2016-09-28 15:35:38	+bdelloid	I see a C/C++ codebase using OpenGL easier to compile down to WebGL than glium
2016-09-28 15:38:40	+trinary	I'd argue that gliums, or rather glutins level of abstraction are very valuable here. If the C/C++ app is not written for OpenGL ES, it will just blow up along the way, whereas glium tries to unify OpenGL with OpenGL ES.
2016-09-28 15:39:29	+bdelloid	yeah, my skepticism is emscripten would be able to figure out the abstractions and compile down to webgl
2016-09-28 15:41:37	+trinary	http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/porting/multimedia_and_graphics/OpenGL-support.html#opengl-support-webgl-subset
2016-09-28 15:42:00	+trinary	You seem to be right, but I don't see why that couldn't work with glium.
2016-09-28 15:43:20	+bdelloid	the GL stuff is loaded dynamically instead of compiled statically, it does a bunch of complicated checks for extensions in different OpenGL versions
2016-09-28 15:43:51	+bdelloid	I'm not saying it's impossible, but I don't see it happening as just a general implementation on emscripten side instead of being glium specific, might be wrong
2016-09-28 15:44:43	+bdelloid	and from what I remember in the cases of Unity and other bullshit engines they jump backwards to try and please the gods
2016-09-28 15:44:56	+bdelloid	so I don't see the "just compile your Rust game to run in the browser" happening

2016-09-28 16:14:37	+tca	it's usually easier to do lists like '(M I)

2016-09-28 17:45:57	+kori	mona: find III, then maybe do another function
2016-09-28 17:46:03	+kori	to drop that and insert an U
2016-09-28 17:46:12	+tca	you can just keep track of III while you go down it anyway, since youw ill having to be inserting itin the middle of thelist
2016-09-28 17:46:17	+mona	so what would search list return?
2016-09-28 17:46:25	+kori	tca: nope, not insert
2016-09-28 17:46:27	+mona	the array index 
2016-09-28 17:46:28	+mona	?
2016-09-28 17:46:28	+kori	drop it
2016-09-28 17:46:45	+kori	mona: good question. thats not useful
2016-09-28 17:46:50	 *	kori deletes code
2016-09-28 17:47:13	+mona	it easy to do (I I I . x) -> (U . x)
2016-09-28 17:47:25	+kori	yeah but thats not the only case
2016-09-28 17:47:35	+mona	so mabye if the list doesnt start start I I I just try recursion on the tail
2016-09-28 17:47:38	+kori	the most common thing would be like
2016-09-28 17:47:42	+kori	(M I I I)
2016-09-28 17:47:48	+kori	its never gonna start I I I
2016-09-28 17:48:08	+tca	kori: if you are walking down the list, some part of it will
2016-09-28 17:48:16	+kori	TRUe
2016-09-28 17:48:18	+tca	you could try an example that just does a 1-length I->U if it makes it easier, then extend it to III->U
2016-09-28 17:48:22	+kori	I can just use monas test then right
2016-09-28 17:49:00	+tca	yep
2016-09-28 17:49:15	+kori	yeah
2016-09-28 17:49:19	+kori	alright

2016-09-28 17:52:50	+kori	delay
2016-09-28 17:52:59	+kori	its so the stream doesnt lag
2016-09-28 17:55:09	+kori	okay I->U is rede
2016-09-28 17:55:21	+kori	wow they sampled california dreamin' for this

2016-09-28 17:55:52	+kori	tight as fuck tbh
2016-09-28 17:56:22	+tca	its lagging for me btw
2016-09-28 17:56:29	+tca	you can drop the framerate really low if you have it high
2016-09-28 17:56:36	+tca	for coding

2016-09-28 18:02:28	+mona	if it (i i i a b c)
2016-09-28 18:02:35	+mona	you need to get (a b c)

2016-09-28 18:18:20	+tca	Arathnim: there's a compiler stream tonight on twitch
2016-09-28 18:18:27	+tca	https://www.twitch.tv/naysayer88
2016-09-28 18:18:44	+Arathnim	Do any of them tell me how to unwind the stack?
2016-09-28 18:18:50	+tca	the guy who made the witness
2016-09-28 18:18:52	+tca	probably not
2016-09-28 18:19:06	+kori	should be gouda
2016-09-28 18:19:08	+tca	unwinding the stack for something specific?
2016-09-28 18:19:21	+kori	yeah it should be up friendos
2016-09-28 18:19:26	+tca	im booted in

2016-09-28 18:19:43	+tca	monitor 1: templeOS ; monitor 2: kori stream
2016-09-28 18:19:48	+mona	what is unwind the stack
2016-09-28 18:20:05	+kori	man
2016-09-28 18:20:08	+kori	now Im stumped
2016-09-28 18:20:18	+kori	I want to like
2016-09-28 18:20:20	+kori	uhhh
2016-09-28 18:20:25	+tca	Arathnim: you mean return-from?
2016-09-28 18:20:34	+Arathnim	yes
2016-09-28 18:20:42	+kori	(dropUU '(M U U I U U) 2) and have it drop the second UU
2016-09-28 18:20:45	+Arathnim	wow, I don't know how I typed that
2016-09-28 18:21:16	+Arathnim	It's where you return to a non-local context, but that requires finding that block, somehow, on the stack.
2016-09-28 18:21:30	+tca	Arathnim: it's statically resolved
2016-09-28 18:21:34	+Arathnim	Oh wait, I'll use see how sbcl does it
2016-09-28 18:21:40	+tca	it's like a normal return
2016-09-28 18:22:14	+tca	the fine details can be a lot of ways but its just jump + set wherever the return value needs to go
2016-09-28 18:22:19	+kori	ill have to use let
2016-09-28 18:22:19	+cosarara	mona: whenever you call a function, the current PC is pushed to the stack. Unwinding means going up the list of functions on the stack up to the exception handler or wherever
2016-09-28 18:22:23	+kori	or whatever, yay
2016-09-28 18:22:36	+tca	cosarara: it can mean a lot of things, and in this case it doesnt
2016-09-28 18:22:36	+mona	oh its like throwing an exception?
2016-09-28 18:22:40	+tca	it's a statically computed jump
2016-09-28 18:22:49	+cosarara	tca: oh sorry didn't read the context
2016-09-28 18:23:12	+Arathnim	How is the jump computed? The block might be at different places on the stack at each instance.
2016-09-28 18:23:38	+tca	the block is just a label in the code
2016-09-28 18:23:46	+tca	and where you put the return value is static as well
2016-09-28 18:23:56	+tca	it depends a lot on your implementation
2016-09-28 18:24:02	+tca	if you have stack allocated values, register, etc
2016-09-28 18:24:29	+Arathnim	I'm aware of how jumps work, that doesn't tell me how far back the stack needs to go in order to restore the context.
2016-09-28 18:24:40	+tca	the stack doesn't need to move at all, depending on your model
2016-09-28 18:25:39	+tca	but you can calculate it statically 100% of the time
2016-09-28 18:25:55	+mona	i dont understand
2016-09-28 18:26:00	+mona	can you show me example code?
2016-09-28 18:26:18	+tca	(let ((a (block foo (begin stuff-that-uses stack ...) (return-from foo 1)))) a)
2016-09-28 18:26:40	+mona	could that be the same as like
2016-09-28 18:26:52	+tca	if its a stack based instruction set, everything in stuff-that-uses stack will already arrive back at the original stack usage
2016-09-28 18:26:53	+mona	having an inner function that gets called straight away
2016-09-28 18:27:02	+Arathnim	That would require keeping track of the amount of stuff on the stack at all times
2016-09-28 18:27:06	+tca	nope!
2016-09-28 18:27:09	+kori	Arathnim: are you watching the stream
2016-09-28 18:27:12	+Arathnim	no
2016-09-28 18:27:12	+kori	tca:  are you
2016-09-28 18:27:15	+kori	uhhhh
2016-09-28 18:27:17	+tca	i am
2016-09-28 18:27:23	+tca	lightly
2016-09-28 18:27:25	+tca	something happen?
2016-09-28 18:27:29	+kori	I'm chaining functions, copying some attempts I did at solving the mupuzzle
2016-09-28 18:27:33	+kori	I want to make a repl later
2016-09-28 18:27:34	+mona	this is awesome
2016-09-28 18:27:35	+mona	its working 
2016-09-28 18:27:39	+kori	and make the functions easier to apply
2016-09-28 18:27:47	+kori	like, rule 1, rule 2, rule 3, rule 4
2016-09-28 18:27:50	+tca	nice
2016-09-28 18:27:54	+tca	you can do that
2016-09-28 18:27:55	+kori	it seems to be working
2016-09-28 18:27:59	+mona	:D
2016-09-28 18:28:05	+kori	well
2016-09-28 18:28:10	+kori	I'll have to change it later
2016-09-28 18:28:13	+kori	but for now its working
2016-09-28 18:28:16	+Arathnim	tca: How is that possible? The block will be at different places on the stack at different points in the execution.
2016-09-28 18:28:28	+kori	im not sure if hofstadter intended for all UU to be dropped
2016-09-28 18:28:35	+kori	or all III to be changed to U
2016-09-28 18:28:43	+mona	(let ((a ((lambda () (begin stuff-that-uses stack ...) (return 1))))) a)
2016-09-28 18:28:44	+kori	im pretty sure it one at a time
2016-09-28 18:28:49	+mona	could you change it into lambda like that?
2016-09-28 18:28:49	+tca	well you have to remember this is two seperate things: 1.code 2. data
2016-09-28 18:29:32	+tca	i'd need to know more about what you have so far to help
2016-09-28 18:29:44	+tca	or i could make an example bytecode output
2016-09-28 18:30:11	+tca	yea you can do that mona 
2016-09-28 18:31:35	+kori	aha 
2016-09-28 18:31:38	+kori	there we go
2016-09-28 18:31:42	+kori	found the example I was looking for
2016-09-28 18:32:00	+kori	suppose I have '(M U I I I I U)
2016-09-28 18:32:04	+Arathnim	It's x86, and I'm trying to figure out how sbcl does it
2016-09-28 18:32:05	+kori	I need to be able to pick what III I want
2016-09-28 18:32:39	+kori	either '(M U U I U) or '(M U I U U)  are possible
2016-09-28 18:32:45	+kori	by applying rule III->U
2016-09-28 18:32:51	+kori	but I cant pick where its gonna be applied
2016-09-28 18:33:18	+tca	you can do that easily
2016-09-28 18:33:25	+Arathnim	Oh, it's only lexically scoped. That makes it easier
2016-09-28 18:33:25	+kori	wow ive been streaming for 2hrs
2016-09-28 18:33:31	+tca	just add a counter, when it hits 0 then execute
2016-09-28 18:33:51	+Arathnim	what
2016-09-28 18:33:55	+tca	talking to kori
2016-09-28 18:34:01	+Arathnim	ah
2016-09-28 18:34:05	+tca	and yea its only lexical, not like catch/throw at all
2016-09-28 18:34:15	+nv	what language should i use to write code on windows that isn't total garbage?
2016-09-28 18:34:16	+mona	maybe when you create a block called 'foo' note down the stack height current $rsp
2016-09-28 18:34:20	+mona	and then when you get return from
2016-09-28 18:34:31	+mona	just set the stack back to that originall height
2016-09-28 18:34:31	+Arathnim	Not a problem, then, it could just be baked-in at compile time.
2016-09-28 18:38:33	+Arathnim	I was wondering how to resolve things like (defun foo (block a (bar))) (defun bar (return-from a 'ayy)), but that won't be an issue, I can just save the information in the stack frame or something.
2016-09-28 18:39:47	+Arathnim	And then backreference.
2016-09-28 18:40:35	+kori	well
2016-09-28 18:40:39	+kori	Ill take care of this tomorrow
2016-09-28 18:40:50	+kori	thanks for watching
2016-09-28 18:40:53	+tca	you did good, kid
2016-09-28 18:41:08	+kori	thanks for the help too
2016-09-28 18:41:09	+Arathnim	block/return-from might be more trouble than they're worth
2016-09-28 18:42:10	+kori	programming really is cool when it works KEK
2016-09-28 18:42:43	+tca	Arathnim: i wouldn't recommend adding them until late in the game
2016-09-28 18:42:49	+tca	at which poitn theya re easy
2016-09-28 18:42:49	+Arathnim	That fucks up exceptions, though, I think.
2016-09-28 18:42:49	+LambdaComplex	tfw several people in here said Rust today
2016-09-28 18:42:53	+tca	but you want a small set of core forms
2016-09-28 18:42:59	+tca	once those work add more
2016-09-28 18:43:46	+Arathnim	There might need to be seperate modes for compiling with and without full enviroments.
2016-09-28 18:43:53	+Arathnim	like, allocation
2016-09-28 18:43:58	+Arathnim	hmmm
2016-09-28 18:45:02	+Arathnim	(declare (freestanding t)) or similar
2016-09-28 18:45:13	+tca	if you can compile "if" you can compile block/return
2016-09-28 18:45:32	+Arathnim	What
2016-09-28 18:46:22	+tca	i'll write about it sometime soon i guess
2016-09-28 18:46:58	+Arathnim	This is an order of magnitude more complex than compiling if.
2016-09-28 18:47:09	+Arathnim	Wait, did you mean only in-function return-from?
2016-09-28 18:47:26	+tca	return-from
2016-09-28 18:47:37	+Arathnim	I'm talking about (block a (foo (lambda () (return-from a))))
2016-09-28 18:47:58	+mona	oh god what the fuck
2016-09-28 18:47:59	+mona	can you do that
2016-09-28 18:48:04	+Arathnim	I realize that it's mostly easy to compile, just a jump
2016-09-28 18:48:12	+mona	thats really crazy
2016-09-28 18:48:13	+Arathnim	But not every case
2016-09-28 18:48:25	+mona	so like
2016-09-28 18:48:26	+mona	inside foo
2016-09-28 18:48:34	+mona	say foo is just (foo x) = (+ 1 (x))
2016-09-28 18:48:42	+tca	it doesnt matter because the lambda can never escape
2016-09-28 18:48:45	+mona	it would actually skip calculating + 1
2016-09-28 18:48:53	+mona	becaues it just returns straight away to 'a'
2016-09-28 18:49:07	+mona	this is lik continuations
2016-09-28 18:49:17	+mona	which is the hardest thing in scheme
2016-09-28 18:49:45	+Arathnim	Yeah, but it has to be compiled as a callable function object which returns to that context in the block
2016-09-28 18:50:05	+Arathnim	As far as I know, this isn't possible without allocation or hacks
2016-09-28 18:51:30	+Arathnim	Actually, there might be a way to fuck with the surrounding form to allow for insertion of values like that.
2016-09-28 19:00:08	+Arathnim	tca: How is the 'foo' stack frame eliminated?
2016-09-28 19:01:37	+tca	you can emit the code to adjust the frame right after the jump label
2016-09-28 19:01:53	+tca	from teh block's frame, so it doesnt need to know about anything inside
2016-09-28 19:02:04	+tca	kidn of like the difference between callee-saves and caller-saves
2016-09-28 19:02:04	+DANtheBEASTman	does scheme have threading macros like clojure?

2016-09-28 19:02:45	+Arathnim	But we don't know how big foo's stack frame is, or how many times it's recursed.

2016-09-28 19:03:05	+tca	yep you have no idea and dont care

2016-09-28 19:03:44	+Arathnim	But we don't know how many bytes to go back to do re-enter the block's frame
2016-09-28 19:04:08	+tca	you dont need to do any work for that, you know the label statically
2016-09-28 19:04:38	+Arathnim	You can jump into the block's code, but you don't know how many you need to offset to restore its lexical variables
2016-09-28 19:04:51	+tca	mnaybe im wrong, but no matter what you can alwys just return from foo normally
2016-09-28 19:04:58	+tca	just without setting the return value
2016-09-28 19:11:39	+Arathnim	I'll just lump that in with lexical closures as 'weird stack things I can't compile yet'

2016-09-28 19:22:37	+Arathnim	A global variable for each block, which contains the stack frame to move the stack back to. Set upon entry of the block.
2016-09-28 19:22:56	+tca	ya that would work
2016-09-28 19:23:28	+tca	you could also have the closure close over the frame data
2016-09-28 19:24:57	+mona	can global variables work?
2016-09-28 19:25:04	+mona	becaues what if you there is recursion
2016-09-28 19:25:05	+Arathnim	It'll mess shit up if you enter the same block twice, though. I'm not even sure how cl handles that, though.
2016-09-28 19:25:08	+mona	and the same block is used twice
2016-09-28 19:25:12	+mona	in different ways
2016-09-28 19:26:21	+tca	if it needs to handle multiple just make the global variables a stack as well and pop from it
2016-09-28 19:26:36	+mona	nah
2016-09-28 19:26:52	+tca	Arathnim: why not ask sbcl people?

2016-09-28 19:27:56	+Arathnim	Excellent idea. Let's see if they do it with extra allocation.
2016-09-28 19:30:07	+Arathnim	Should probably ask lisp first

2016-10-03 13:24:30	+JX7P	How SmallTalk-72 worked. SmallTalk-72 was derived from S-Logo, a variant of the LISP 1.6 programming language. Objects were effectively lambda expressions crossed with macros: they processed a message stream consisting of the text coming after a message send to them. With pre-provided functionality to parse the message being available (though not mandated; you could choose any grammar for messages) the class definition would begin to look 
2016-10-03 13:24:30	+JX7P	like a big Lisp lambda with a cond statement on the various keywords of the message.

2016-10-03 16:37:05	+JX7P	hideous comment
2016-10-03 16:37:29	+JX7P	this is not progress but regress. writing for bare-metal is challenging and involves lots of repetition. it's also inherently limiting
2016-10-03 16:38:15	+JX7P	i have been convinced for a while that the answer to our problems is to declare an end to the unix age, which is so taken for granted today, and begin the object age
2016-10-03 16:38:36	+JX7P	that is, an operating system ought to be more like a smalltalk image, and applications be objects
2016-10-03 16:39:44	+JX7P	we need, of course, a security mechanism there. something smalltalk never focused on much, but something i would like to research
2016-10-03 16:40:11	+JX7P	i think it's sick and wrong that we are today 'solving' our security issues by running our applications inside another OS inside an application

2016-10-03 16:41:22	+Arathnim	On that point, I agree. You either have to have security built into the user-facing language, or solid memory protection, not half-measures.
2016-10-03 16:42:18	+JX7P	one place where i take a particularly radical line is the operating system itself
2016-10-03 16:42:42	+JX7P	the kernel having full access to the entire system of applications is taken for granted, but it could be done away with
2016-10-03 16:45:21	+ajimu	I much agree about ending the unix age, but at present we're facing its decline for desktops
2016-10-03 16:46:03	+JX7P	i think it's clear that desktops are likely going to disappear

2016-10-03 16:46:55	+JX7P	we are moving towards the era of sealed-box computers-as-consumer-electronics and it's tragic
2016-10-03 16:47:13	+JX7P	on a side note, solaris was my favourite unix because of it actually innovating significantly
2016-10-03 16:48:05	+JX7P	8 years ago i remember dragging a slider along my home folder and watching as it traced back through 2 months of changes. i could access things at any point. linux only recently gained a NIH of this in btr-fs
2016-10-03 16:48:48	+JX7P	oh, why do people still think "worse is better" was a non-ironic statement? why do people worship ugliness, mediocrity, and stagnation?
2016-10-03 16:49:28	+Arathnim	It's the "right" thing vs. the simple thing.
2016-10-03 16:49:33	+JX7P	i almost begin to like systemd for shaking up the dismal state of system management - even if it simply put that dismal state in a glass, shat in it, and served it as a cocktail
2016-10-03 16:49:59	+Arathnim	implementation simplicity and interface simplicity
2016-10-03 16:51:02	+JX7P	and my own system xvi, in retrospect, was basically an attempt to impose on systems an objects-style approach to service management, by creating vast translation layers (the restarter delegates) for a simple message-based management system
2016-10-03 16:52:51	+ajimu	"worse is better" was about gaining market and moving quickly. it was never about quality
2016-10-03 16:53:08	+JX7P	you are quite right. this is the free market at work
2016-10-03 16:53:32	+JX7P	it does not see or hear for quality and rightness, only for marketing prowess
2016-10-03 16:53:42	+ajimu	yep
2016-10-03 16:54:18	+ajimu	higher quality loses because people will take something that kinda works over something that works well every time, as long as it's faster and convenient
2016-10-03 16:54:32	+ajimu	this also means anything actually new is gonna fail to gain adoption
2016-10-03 16:54:52	+ajimu	and under capitalism adoption determines what influence you have over future tech
2016-10-03 16:55:05	+ajimu	e.g. in standards discussions
2016-10-03 16:55:42	+ajimu	or in influencing similar "competing" projects
2016-10-03 16:55:52	+JX7P	there were a whole series of incredible developments that should've been the future of computing but they ended up getting recuperated, to translate a term onto a different analysand
2016-10-03 16:55:56	+ajimu	so worse *wins* but it's not better

2016-10-03 16:59:04	+ajimu	the only major change I recall with windows is something to do with a misunderstanding of how the smalltalk windows worked by the apple people
2016-10-03 16:59:54	+ajimu	the common misconception is that the market gives people what they "want"

2016-10-03 17:18:10	+trinary	No, why does he want one?
2016-10-03 17:18:11	+ajimu	if he just got an iPhone it'd make him look bad after all
2016-10-03 17:18:40	+ajimu	that's the question I was answering
2016-10-03 17:18:41	+bdelloid	kek
2016-10-03 17:18:51	+bdelloid	god I hate Rust so much
2016-10-03 17:18:57	+bdelloid	fix the fucking borrow checker already
2016-10-03 17:19:14	+Uncled1023	isn't rust open source?
2016-10-03 17:19:15	+trinary	Lexical only borrows biting you?
2016-10-03 17:19:28	+ajimu	what's wrong with the borrow checker?
2016-10-03 17:19:29	+kori	i kinda miss the google is a botnet meme
2016-10-03 17:19:32	+bdelloid	trinary, something even worse, that will unlikely be fixed
2016-10-03 17:19:35	+trinary	ajimu - Then I guess I didn't understand that explanation.
2016-10-03 17:19:37	+kori	that was a good meme
2016-10-03 17:19:42	+bdelloid	I need to downgrade a mutable reference to an immutable one
2016-10-03 17:19:50	+trinary	kori - Why do you want that phone?
2016-10-03 17:19:52	+ajimu	> it's open source so you don't have the right to expect anyone to fix their shit
2016-10-03 17:19:56	+bdelloid	but the lifetimes are always conflated
2016-10-03 17:19:56	+trinary	bdelloid - Oh, right, I saw.
2016-10-03 17:20:02	+kori	trinary: 1. android 2. looks like an iphone tbh
2016-10-03 17:20:14	+kori	I like the shape of the iphone
2016-10-03 17:20:18	+trinary	kori - Why's 2 a good point?
2016-10-03 17:20:23	+trinary	Oh.
2016-10-03 17:20:27	+bdelloid	but meh
2016-10-03 17:20:31	+bdelloid	I guess I need to fix the design
2016-10-03 17:20:51	+bdelloid	I don't like the way it does this honestly
2016-10-03 17:21:37	+trinary	kori - I can recommend the OP3 if you're just looking for a new phone.
2016-10-03 17:21:57	+ajimu	because kori wishes he were an applefag
2016-10-03 17:22:00	+trinary	(Judge for yourself how much it looks like an iphone)
2016-10-03 17:22:08	+bdelloid	I guess I can do something really ugly
2016-10-03 17:22:54	+kori	trinary: nevermind the weirdly shaped home button, Hey, That's Pretty Good!™
2016-10-03 17:23:20	+kori	I mean, I'll stick with my moto g for maybe a year or two more
2016-10-03 17:23:31	+kori	well
2016-10-03 17:23:41	+kori	I'll stick with it for as long as it is sufficient

2016-10-03 17:41:59	+bdelloid	trinary, I need to redesign this thing
2016-10-03 17:42:04	+bdelloid	I'm thinking about using mio
2016-10-03 17:42:10	+bdelloid	but maybe futures are better
2016-10-03 17:42:14	+trinary	I don't know what lifetime you would want t to have.
2016-10-03 17:42:26	+bdelloid	trinary, an equivalent lifetime, but immutable
2016-10-03 17:42:50	+bdelloid	I'm calling foo(&mut self) -> impl Iterator<Item = &T>
2016-10-03 17:42:59	+bdelloid	but anyway
2016-10-03 17:43:02	+bdelloid	I think I'll go with futures
2016-10-03 17:43:05	+bdelloid	probably
2016-10-03 17:43:35	+trinary	Huh? It will have the same lifetime as the one you passed in. Is that not equivalent
2016-10-03 17:43:37	+trinary	*?

2016-10-03 17:48:02	+trinary	Sure, that's what you asked it for. You can't &self?
2016-10-03 17:48:14	+bdelloid	trinary, no
2016-10-03 17:48:22	+trinary	Why not?
2016-10-03 17:48:23	+bdelloid	I want &mut self, but &mut is not needed for the references returned
2016-10-03 17:48:29	+bdelloid	because I need to mutate
2016-10-03 17:48:35	+bdelloid	and return immutable references, with self as immutable
2016-10-03 17:48:50	+trinary	Internal mutability?
2016-10-03 17:48:53	+bdelloid	nope
2016-10-03 17:48:57	+trinary	Why not?
2016-10-03 17:48:59	+bdelloid	would slow everything down
2016-10-03 17:49:04	+bdelloid	it's not internal mutability either
2016-10-03 17:49:07	+bdelloid	it's external
2016-10-03 17:49:10	+bdelloid	but not needed after
2016-10-03 17:49:28	+bdelloid	the call needs &mut self
2016-10-03 17:49:32	+bdelloid	but after the return, it does not
2016-10-03 17:49:43	+bdelloid	but you can't drop the mutable after you get the &T
2016-10-03 17:49:50	+bdelloid	self will still be &mut
2016-10-03 17:49:56	+bdelloid	so you can't call other immutable methods on it
2016-10-03 18:04:32	+bdelloid	reeee
2016-10-03 18:15:21	+trinary	I'd have to see more context, but if you're going to restructure anyway... Is "cancer open" supposed to do anything?
2016-10-03 18:23:45	+bdelloid	trinary, yeah, open the window
2016-10-03 18:23:51	+bdelloid	and show the cursor
2016-10-03 18:25:54	+trinary	That doesn't happen, and RUST_LOG=debug doesn't give any information I could give you.

2016-10-03 18:26:14	+bdelloid	it's still under volatile development
2016-10-03 18:26:22	+trinary	Sure, I'll check again later.
2016-10-03 18:26:36	+bdelloid	does it crash?
2016-10-03 18:26:41	+bdelloid	like a segfault
2016-10-03 18:26:48	+bdelloid	if it segfaults I still fucked up the pty stuff
2016-10-03 18:29:28	+trinary	No, it just doesn't do anything. The process doesn't terminate until I ^C it.
2016-10-03 18:29:51	+trinary	(It probably does *something*, but nothing I can directly observe)

2016-10-05 21:55:46	+bdelloid	what else would I be using
2016-10-05 21:56:02	+LambdaComplex	maybe fish
2016-10-05 21:56:11	+bdelloid	I hate fish

2016-10-05 22:03:47	+bdelloid	kori, help me out, I know you can
2016-10-05 22:03:53	+kori	what do you need
2016-10-05 22:04:12	+bdelloid	well
2016-10-05 22:04:23	+bdelloid	first I need to remember the higher bits for utf-8
2016-10-05 22:04:31	+bdelloid	then I need to see which fall within an escape code as well
2016-10-05 22:05:26	+kori	that went right over my head
2016-10-05 22:05:57	+bdelloid	yeah
2016-10-05 22:05:58	+bdelloid	they fall
2016-10-05 22:06:01	+bdelloid	which means
2016-10-05 22:06:11	+bdelloid	I need to extract one character at a time
2016-10-05 22:06:28	+bdelloid	this sucks
2016-10-05 22:07:40	+LambdaComplex	d-did cthuko just call me cute
2016-10-05 22:08:05	+cthuko	LambdaComplex: yes :3
2016-10-05 22:08:22	 *	LambdaComplex wonders if cthuko even knows what he looks like
2016-10-05 22:08:46	+cthuko	lol
2016-10-05 22:08:50	+ajimu	what's that got to do with cuteness
2016-10-05 22:09:01	+ajimu	,cute cthuko
2016-10-05 22:09:03	+cthuko	Did not get it, LambdaComplex
2016-10-05 22:09:09	+LambdaComplex	depending on how you define cuteness, perhaps "everything"
2016-10-05 22:09:19	+cthuko	ajimu: <3
2016-10-05 22:09:23	+bdelloid	guess I need a nom parser for utf8
2016-10-05 22:09:30	+LambdaComplex	bdelloid: i'm sorry
2016-10-05 22:09:33	+cthuko	What do I look like, LambdaComplex?
2016-10-05 22:09:39	+LambdaComplex	cthuko: i have no clue
2016-10-05 22:09:50	+LambdaComplex	i don't know what anyone here looks like
2016-10-05 22:09:53	+bdelloid	if there was an str::from_utf8 that would read just one character
2016-10-05 22:09:55	+LambdaComplex	except.... Lynn and DANtheBEASTman and kyubiko 
2016-10-05 22:10:06	+cthuko	Everyone here is a persona
2016-10-05 22:10:19	+kori	 cthuko ha-ha
2016-10-05 22:10:21	+kori	I sure wish
2016-10-05 22:10:31	+cthuko	Cuteness isn't strictly about appearances
2016-10-05 22:10:35	+LambdaComplex	bdelloid: chars().nth(1)?
2016-10-05 22:10:43	+bdelloid	LambdaComplex, I don't have an str
2016-10-05 22:10:51	+DANtheBEASTman	tfw still no selfie from ajimu 
2016-10-05 22:11:23	+LambdaComplex	bdelloid: str::from_utf8().unwrap().chars().nth(1)?
2016-10-05 22:11:48	+bdelloid	LambdaComplex, that will take the whole input, which won't be utf8
2016-10-05 22:12:03	+LambdaComplex	bdelloid: back up and explain what you're actually trying to do
2016-10-05 22:12:08	+bdelloid	no
2016-10-05 22:12:08	+LambdaComplex	DANtheBEASTman: iktf
2016-10-05 22:12:13	+LambdaComplex	bdelloid: why not
2016-10-05 22:12:13	+bdelloid	I know it can't be done within libstd
2016-10-05 22:12:22	+LambdaComplex	bdelloid: but i wanna know anyways!
2016-10-05 22:12:25	+bdelloid	takes time, not cost effective
2016-10-05 22:13:48	+LambdaComplex	as opposed to ranting about it?
2016-10-05 22:13:52	+bdelloid	yes
2016-10-05 22:14:01	+bdelloid	ranting is good
2016-10-05 22:14:02	+LambdaComplex	tfw #code is now bdelloid's soapbox
2016-10-05 22:14:13	+bdelloid	hey, any current IRC window is just my thought dump

2016-10-05 22:14:35	+LambdaComplex	ajimu: install gentoo
2016-10-05 22:14:39	+ajimu	task manager and msconfig ain't showing shit
2016-10-05 22:14:47	+LambdaComplex	is there a "startup items" folder?
2016-10-05 22:14:47	+ajimu	at least I think this is 10
2016-10-05 22:14:54	+ajimu	it might be 8
2016-10-05 22:14:54	+LambdaComplex	....you don't know?

2016-10-09 13:49:47	+Lynn	jumi: yes.
2016-10-09 13:50:00	+jumi	Lynn hey man wassup
2016-10-09 13:50:01	+kyubiko	onodera: what compositor?
2016-10-09 13:50:08	+kyubiko	you can give unmanaged windows shadows
2016-10-09 13:50:12	+onodera	compton
2016-10-09 13:50:19	+kyubiko	yeah you can give unmanaged shadows
2016-10-09 13:50:26	+onodera	anyways I think no shadows on the popups look better anyways
2016-10-09 13:50:29	+kyubiko	you'll have turned it off in your settings
2016-10-09 13:50:45	+kyubiko	if you ever want shadows on n30f then turn on shadows everywhere in compton
2016-10-09 13:50:52	+kyubiko	and instead blacklist by window class in compton config
2016-10-09 13:51:04	+kyubiko	and then cos you can change the window class/title using an option in an n30f
2016-10-09 13:51:57	+kyubiko	you can have shadows on some n30f windows
2016-10-09 13:51:59	+kyubiko	and not on others
2016-10-09 13:52:40	+jumi	onodera see
2016-10-09 13:52:49	+jumi	muh man kyubiko just gave you the steps

2016-10-10 12:07:00	+kori	I've built a kind of consistent design language
2016-10-10 12:07:14	+kori	However, things are falling apart
2016-10-10 12:07:30	+kori	I think I could probably build a good DE
2016-10-10 12:08:05	+kori	The problem is that things that rely heavily on state don't make much sense to me anymore
2016-10-10 12:08:50	+kori	I don't think there's some kind of functional wm
2016-10-10 12:08:56	+kori	Or whether that's even possible

2016-10-10 12:21:07	+kori	nevermind the functional desktop idea, a good step for creating a very consistent DE would be to use libraries for each part of the desktop
2016-10-10 12:21:21	+kori	that would of course require a common language
2016-10-10 12:21:23	+kori	my best bet is guile
2016-10-10 12:22:36	+gnu	it would require javascript
2016-10-10 12:22:39	+gnu	and it would be called GNOME

2016-10-11 00:03:18	+bdelloid	http://www.hnng.moe/f/Ikj about half of the runtime is spent nowhere
2016-10-11 00:04:06	+bdelloid	which is likely time spent rendering inside cairo

2016-10-11 00:04:24	+bdelloid	the only way to render faster is to render less
2016-10-11 00:05:27	+nv	are you doing cargo run --release?
2016-10-11 00:05:35	+nv	might be spent on debugging info

2016-10-11 00:07:01	+bdelloid	but yeah
2016-10-11 00:07:08	+bdelloid	just need to do more checks
2016-10-11 00:07:21	+bdelloid	it's all a matter of finding the right cost between doing stricter checking on dirtyness
2016-10-11 00:07:24	+bdelloid	and the time it takes rendering
2016-10-11 00:07:56	+bdelloid	the sad part is
2016-10-11 00:08:05	+bdelloid	rendering performance scales with the size of the terminal
2016-10-11 00:08:11	+bdelloid	and if it's already that slow on an 80x24
2016-10-11 00:08:22	+bdelloid	I'm gonna get fucked when I use one at the dimensions I use

2016-10-11 17:31:11	+bdelloid	it's REALLY slow
2016-10-11 17:31:15	+bdelloid	I'm refactoring the whole rendering shit

2016-10-11 17:32:11	+bdelloid	imagine at 300x80
2016-10-11 17:32:32	+bdelloid	it takes a whole second
2016-10-11 17:32:37	+bdelloid	to render that shit

2016-10-11 17:32:58	+bdelloid	because 1920 cells against 24000?
2016-10-11 17:34:00	+trinary	And other terminals are significantly faster, I assume?

2016-10-13 10:22:27	+neeasade	the reson for the query in the middle is because it acts on either the desktop or the group of nodes currently selected
2016-10-13 10:22:53	+neeasade	the '@/' is shorthand for current desktop
2016-10-13 10:23:29	+naughtsee	:o
2016-10-13 10:23:52	+naughtsee	How is that, exactly? '@' is a special thing right? Points ot something or other
2016-10-13 10:25:00	+naughtsee	also this looks a lot more complex than sxhkdrc configs used to be  with all the !leaf and whatnot
2016-10-13 10:25:02	+neeasade	yeah it's the path notation -  @[DESKTOP_SEL:][[/]JUMP](/JUMP)* - desktop_sel defaults to current desktop
2016-10-13 10:25:49	+neeasade	it looks complex because I'll do sweep throughs for DRY on occasion, and I'm comfortable with those queries inline

2016-10-14 18:30:03	+bdelloid	the string type is only one

2016-10-14 18:30:06	+bdelloid	it's str
2016-10-14 18:30:15	+LambdaComplex	well, you've got String, OsString, and Cstring
2016-10-14 18:30:18	+bdelloid	String is just an owned buffer for str

2016-10-14 18:30:22	+LambdaComplex	yeah
2016-10-14 18:30:25	+joe_dirt	lol
2016-10-14 18:30:25	+bdelloid	OsString is not an str, it's an owned buffer for [u8]

2016-10-14 18:30:37	+LambdaComplex	depends on how pedantic you wanna be tbh

2016-10-14 18:31:02	+joe_dirt	it is

2016-10-14 18:31:56	+bdelloid	char in C is not a byte
2016-10-14 18:32:01	+bdelloid	in Rust char is what LambdaComplex said
2016-10-14 18:32:20	+bdelloid	and in Rust an str is not an array of char
2016-10-14 18:32:32	+bdelloid	it's an array of u8 that is ensured to be valid UTF-8

2016-10-14 18:33:09	+bdelloid	joe_dirt, char in C is not a byte
2016-10-14 18:33:14	+joe_dirt	bdelloid: yes it is
2016-10-14 18:33:34	+bdelloid	no
2016-10-14 18:33:39	+bdelloid	it's CHAR_BIT bits
2016-10-14 18:33:46	+joe_dirt	17:30 <+joe_dirt> at least on x86
2016-10-14 18:34:10	+bdelloid	that's implementation dependant, which is irrelevant when talking about the language itself and the definition of types
2016-10-14 18:34:14	+kori	Herald's on its way BOYZZZ
2016-10-14 18:34:55	+bdelloid	you could have a compiler for x86 that defines char as 1 bit
2016-10-14 18:35:12	+joe_dirt	you could but it'd be wrong
2016-10-14 18:35:21	+bdelloid	it would be valid
2016-10-14 18:35:23	+bdelloid	useless, but valid
2016-10-14 18:35:33	+bdelloid	because char is not a byte by specification
2016-10-14 18:36:03	+LambdaComplex	bdelloid: so is Cstr/Cstring useful for anything besides ffi?
2016-10-14 18:36:13	+joe_dirt	it needs to hold 0-255 unsigned
2016-10-14 18:36:18	+bdelloid	LambdaComplex, no
2016-10-14 18:36:24	+LambdaComplex	didn't think so
2016-10-14 18:36:26	+LambdaComplex	thanks bdelloid 
2016-10-14 18:36:37	+bdelloid	joe_dirt, it does not
2016-10-14 18:37:05	+joe_dirt	citation needed
2016-10-14 18:37:10	+bdelloid	char just defines the size of the other types
2016-10-14 18:37:17	+bdelloid	sizeof char is always 1 by specification
2016-10-14 18:37:21	+bdelloid	the bits in char are defined by CHAR_BITS
2016-10-14 18:37:41	+bdelloid	CHAR_BITS could be 4 if you felt like it, and it would all still work
2016-10-14 18:37:56	+bdelloid	the fact that would be retarded on x86 is irrelevant, and doesn't make char a byte

2016-10-14 21:02:16	+bdelloid	I don't
2016-10-14 21:02:57	+abunai	I don't think anyone does, because it's only a very small subset of people enmeshed in SV culture that actually give time estimates
2016-10-14 21:03:16	+bdelloid	I don't have to-do lists either

2016-10-14 21:03:46	+naughtsee	you feel so productive and do things instead of ricing
2016-10-14 21:05:27	+bdelloid	I don't know

2016-10-14 21:49:55	+bdelloid	the difference in paddings top/bottom - left/right makes my autism hurt
2016-10-14 21:50:28	+naughtsee	on the panel?
2016-10-14 21:51:22	+bdelloid	yes
2016-10-14 21:51:43	+bdelloid	the left light blue has also a different padding from the right 
2016-10-14 21:51:47	+bdelloid	in the inner part
2016-10-14 21:51:58	+naughtsee	does it?
2016-10-14 21:52:12	+bdelloid	yes
2016-10-14 21:52:16	+naughtsee	Are you positive
2016-10-14 21:52:26	+naughtsee	because it doesn't look that way to me
2016-10-14 21:52:37	+bdelloid	dunno, maybe it's not
2016-10-14 21:52:40	+bdelloid	but if my eyes don't play me
2016-10-14 21:52:43	+bdelloid	there's a 1 pixel difference
2016-10-14 21:52:46	+bdelloid	probably because of the font
2016-10-14 21:52:59	+naughtsee	they're just standard spaces w/ a fixed width font 
2016-10-14 21:53:23	+naughtsee	the difference would be larger I feel
2016-10-14 21:53:32	+bdelloid	no, 1 pixel is okay
2016-10-14 21:53:35	+bdelloid	because like
2016-10-14 21:53:40	+bdelloid	|x |
2016-10-14 21:53:44	+bdelloid	x is the glyph
2016-10-14 21:53:48	+bdelloid	|  | is the width of the glyph
2016-10-14 21:53:52	+bdelloid	one ends, one starts
2016-10-14 21:53:58	+bdelloid	there's probably 1 pixel difference
2016-10-14 21:54:02	+bdelloid	from the one that ends, has 1 pixel empty space
2016-10-14 21:54:08	+bdelloid	from the one that starts, the glyph starts at the first pixel
2016-10-14 21:54:20	+bdelloid	ok, Imma measure it
2016-10-14 21:54:31	+bdelloid	my autism must know
2016-10-14 21:55:08	+kori	naughtsee: make the bar like
2016-10-14 21:55:09	+naughtsee	LOL I appreciate your service if it is indeed off
2016-10-14 21:55:10	+kori	2px taller
2016-10-14 21:55:24	+naughtsee	oh right, I was gonna try to powerline it and my glyph was short but you're totally right. thanks for reminding me
2016-10-14 21:55:29	+bdelloid	left side has 7 pixel space, right side has 6
2016-10-14 21:55:33	+bdelloid	I'm a god amongst men
2016-10-14 21:55:37	+naughtsee	holy shiiiiiit
2016-10-14 21:55:48	+naughtsee	how the fuck do I fix that 
2016-10-14 21:55:53	+bdelloid	by not using spaces
2016-10-14 21:56:04	+naughtsee	it can't be flush tho
2016-10-14 21:56:16	+bdelloid	naughtsee, aren't you impressed by my eyes?
2016-10-14 21:56:21	+bdelloid	I am
2016-10-14 21:56:27	+bdelloid	this is a 1080p 15" monitor
2016-10-14 21:56:58	+naughtsee	I'm 100% impressed
2016-10-14 21:57:08	+naughtsee	I'm barely noticing it now
2016-10-14 21:57:11	+naughtsee	damn you
2016-10-14 22:01:46	+bdelloid	naughtsee, a simple way to fix it is adding a private codepoint to your BDF font
2016-10-14 22:01:53	+bdelloid	with a character that has a single line at the far right
2016-10-14 22:01:57	+bdelloid	and make it that color
2016-10-14 22:02:02	+bdelloid	fixed
2016-10-14 22:02:48	+naughtsee	"simple"
2016-10-14 22:02:56	+naughtsee	read "more work than it's worth"
2016-10-14 22:03:00	+naughtsee	until I finish the other scripts that is
2016-10-14 22:03:37	+bdelloid	nigga it's like 3 minutes
2016-10-14 22:03:45	+naughtsee	not for me
2016-10-14 22:03:47	+naughtsee	I don't know how to do that
2016-10-14 22:04:02	+bdelloid	gbdfed
2016-10-14 22:04:25	+naughtsee	so make a 1px character
2016-10-14 22:04:35	+kori	by suckless standards that is a simple fix :^)
2016-10-14 22:04:38	+bdelloid	glyphs are all the same size in Bdf
2016-10-14 22:04:39	+kori	its not the Correct
2016-10-14 22:04:41	+kori	fix though
2016-10-14 22:04:57	+bdelloid	just draw one single pixel line on the right side of the glyph
2016-10-14 22:05:07	+bdelloid	then use that character with the darker blue foreground
2016-10-14 22:05:25	+bdelloid	naughtsee, http://www.hnng.moe/f/Iwl see all those icons on the bottom bar? I drew them with gbdfed
2016-10-14 22:07:07	+naughtsee	that makes sense
2016-10-14 22:07:14	+naughtsee	but my broked font is dumb
2016-10-14 22:15:49	+jiaxsun	Smart friendos
2016-10-14 22:16:10	+jiaxsun	I'm trying to figure out how to get grub to have an entry for Windows 10
2016-10-14 22:16:26	+jiaxsun	I know where the windows bootloader is partitionwise
2016-10-14 22:16:41	+jiaxsun	But I can't figure out what I need to do to get it to show up in grun
2016-10-14 22:17:48	+bdelloid	jiaxsun, did you generate your GRUB config or made it yourself?
2016-10-14 22:23:39	+jiaxsun	Generated it
2016-10-14 22:23:50	+jiaxsun	But I just tried making a custom entry, lemme see if that works
2016-10-14 22:23:59	+jiaxsun	Prolly not since I got it from a debian wiki lmao
2016-10-14 22:24:37	+jiaxsun	FUCK yeah I think we're in business m8s

2016-10-14 22:46:29	+bdelloid	naughtsee, anything
2016-10-14 22:46:33	+bdelloid	I'd go with Ruby
2016-10-14 22:46:36	+naughtsee	that's why there was no case kori

2016-10-14 22:47:15	+kori	lul
2016-10-14 22:47:26	+bdelloid	C is the lingua franca of the programming world, it will always be
2016-10-14 22:47:33	+naughtsee	why wouldn't you start with C
2016-10-14 22:47:41	+bdelloid	well, C is a pretty shit language
2016-10-14 22:47:50	+bdelloid	but I don't get starting with one language
2016-10-14 22:47:58	+bdelloid	when I started I started with Java, C and C#, for different purposes
2016-10-14 22:48:08	+naughtsee	I feel like C really helped me understand programming better
2016-10-14 22:48:19	+naughtsee	Java didn't make sense to me at all
2016-10-14 22:48:21	+naughtsee	Which is what I first tried
2016-10-14 22:49:31	+naughtsee	brb 
2016-10-14 22:52:44	+kori	java doesnt make any sense and I'm surprised it exists
2016-10-14 22:53:24	+bdelloid	how does it not make any sense
2016-10-14 22:53:34	+bdelloid	it's a shit language, but it makes sense

One example of its aggressive response to an aspect of the crisis of C is the extremely secure memory management demanded by Rustlang of its programmers: you cannot just play games and allocate things to keep pointers to, not without preparation.
