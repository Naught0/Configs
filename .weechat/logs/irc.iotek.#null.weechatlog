2014-12-04 22:46:24	@voni	o rite
2014-12-04 22:47:11	@mkfs	the reason I'd rather have people use the same nicks they use on Rizon is because by doing so, they can mess with their desktop lists and they'll sync
2014-12-04 22:47:37	+xwlf	My nick is similarat least.
2014-12-04 22:47:37	@voni	right

2014-12-04 22:48:00	@voni	kek
2014-12-04 22:48:02	@mkfs	voni: no idea
2014-12-04 22:48:06	@voni	hrmm
2014-12-04 22:48:15	@mkfs	xwlf: I don't think it's similar, but ok
2014-12-04 22:48:16	@voni	I think it was default before but I changed it
2014-12-04 22:48:31	notc	voni: that there is a sexy desktop
2014-12-04 22:48:38	+xwlf	It's about as close as I could get without blatantly putting "wolf".
2014-12-04 22:48:39	@voni	mkfs: what editor do you use anyway
2014-12-04 22:48:41	@voni	notc: ty

2014-12-04 22:49:21	@voni	notc: being cool
2014-12-04 22:49:25	notc	what's it do
2014-12-04 22:49:31	@voni	well
2014-12-04 22:49:44	@voni	all it really does rn is add double window borders and mouse focus for me
2014-12-04 22:49:51	@mkfs	voni: and sublime text is available, Notepad++, etc
2014-12-04 22:49:55	@voni	default it lets you move windows with the mouse but I removed
2014-12-04 22:49:56	@mkfs	I like Notepad2
2014-12-04 22:50:00	@voni	mkfs: o k
2014-12-04 22:50:04	@voni	I liked atom because github
2014-12-04 22:50:11	@voni	but its 2heavy for my aspire
2014-12-04 22:50:34	@voni	notc: I only use swm because of the mouse focus
2014-12-04 22:50:38	@voni	wmutils really handles my windows
2014-12-04 22:51:00	notc	uhh

2014-12-04 22:51:23	@voni	smaller, without the broken shit, and with double borders
2014-12-04 22:51:57	@voni	double borders are p sexy
2014-12-04 23:19:28	@voni	ugh, is it bad that I like sublime so much
2014-12-04 23:21:59	notc	sublime text?
2014-12-04 23:22:18	@voni	yeah
2014-12-04 23:22:49	notc	it's 8/10, that's why
2014-12-04 23:23:10	@voni	kek
2014-12-04 23:23:20	@voni	it's just so smooth and there's so many features and ugh
2014-12-04 23:23:29	@voni	if it wasn't proprietary it'd be 10/10
2014-12-04 23:23:34	@voni	but I can understand it
2014-12-04 23:26:45	notc	it's pr ok
2014-12-04 23:26:57	notc	proprietary isn't necessarily a bad thing
2014-12-04 23:27:01	notc	how else would programmers make money
2014-12-04 23:27:58	@voni	mmhm
2014-12-04 23:29:54	notc	I think the crusades against proprietary software are autistic. If you don't like it, then don't use it. It's completely unreasonable to think all software should be free and open.
2014-12-04 23:29:59	notc	Anyway, good night frienderinos

2014-12-05 16:03:32	@voni	I'm looking at the catv page
2014-12-05 16:03:32	@mkfs	voni: C++ is C, but + 1

2014-12-05 16:04:17	@mkfs	I've never had any experience with java
2014-12-05 16:04:20	xcel	java is a bloated mess, because it is ported to every platform.
2014-12-05 16:04:22	@voni	it's p ew
2014-12-05 16:04:31	@voni	yeah, it's got a lot of bloat, as well as jut taking forever to write

2014-12-05 16:06:12	@voni	and awesomewm was kinda ok but I don't like the bloat
2014-12-05 16:06:13	xcel	surprised mkfs, http://suckless.org/
2014-12-05 16:06:16	kybk	they made dwm and wmii and all sorts of "unix philosphy" tuff
2014-12-05 16:06:31	xcel	they make software that suckless
2014-12-05 16:06:34	@voni	dwm is p cool but I don't want to recompile to customize everything
2014-12-05 16:06:37	xcel	dwm is only 5k lines of code
2014-12-05 16:06:38	@voni	swm is the only exception in that case
2014-12-05 16:06:40	xcel	i think
2014-12-05 16:07:41	@voni	Children are nothing more than a toy some parents use to feed their ego and feel important. They are a nuisance and make life miserable for everyone else around.
2014-12-05 16:07:45	@voni	haha what
2014-12-05 16:08:15	@voni	wow
2014-12-05 16:08:17	xcel	voni: read what he says on religion and agnositc, make me kek
2014-12-05 16:08:18	@mkfs	nice
2014-12-05 16:08:44	@voni	I was about to say " I agree with a few points when it comes to cat-v's opinions"
2014-12-05 16:08:49	@voni	now I just can't even
2014-12-05 16:09:52	xcel	voni: I tend to think he make good point on some stuff or a lot
2014-12-05 16:10:06	@voni	when it comes to the software section, I agree partially
2014-12-05 16:10:13	@voni	other than that, some of this is just rediculous
2014-12-05 16:10:40	xcel	voni: this one was funny http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/operating-systems/linux/linux.gif
2014-12-05 16:11:59	@voni	Another bunch of ignorant bullshit about your children: school uniforms. Bad
2014-12-05 16:11:59	@voni	theory! The idea that if kids wear uniforms to school, it helps keep order.
2014-12-05 16:11:59	@voni	Hey! Don't these schools do enough damage makin' all these children think
2014-12-05 16:12:00	@voni	alike? Now they're gonna get 'em to look alike, too?
2014-12-05 16:12:16	@voni	http://harmful.cat-v.org/society/children/fuck_the_children
2014-12-05 16:12:21	@voni	I agree with some of this
2014-12-05 16:12:49	@voni	You want to know how to help your kids?
2014-12-05 16:12:50	@voni	Leave them the fuck alone.
2014-12-05 16:12:52	@voni	that was a good line
2014-12-05 16:12:53	@voni	I like that
2014-12-05 16:13:08	kybk	it's just a quote from a commedian isn't it
2014-12-05 16:13:18	kybk	and edgemaste commedian at that
2014-12-05 16:13:32	@voni	idk if it's a comedian
2014-12-05 16:14:08	xcel	voni: i always found uniforms ridiculous.
2014-12-05 16:14:20	@voni	always.
2014-12-05 16:14:25	@voni	there's no denying it
2014-12-05 16:14:29	@voni	like, let's say
2014-12-05 16:14:41	@voni	the rule against "PDA"s that they have at almost any school
2014-12-05 16:14:51	@voni	sure, noone wants to see people making out in the middle of a hallway or something
2014-12-05 16:14:55	xcel	The other argument was that "what if somebody comes into the school that not attending"?
2014-12-05 16:15:05	@voni	but adults can do it in the middle of the sidewalk and the police don't throw them in prison
2014-12-05 16:15:18	@voni	the only reason minors can't is because they have no rights to do anything about it
2014-12-05 16:16:12	@voni	ugh, I've gotta say this guy is completely insane but i agree with some of it
2014-12-05 16:16:21	@voni	http://harmful.cat-v.org/society/children/i_dont_care
2014-12-05 16:16:50	@mkfs	I'm reading cat-v now

2014-12-05 16:17:06	@voni	I really really really like some of it
2014-12-05 16:17:10	@voni	and I really really really hate some of it
2014-12-05 16:17:38	kybk	cat-v is autism in writing

2015-01-02 00:14:30	voni	just
2015-01-02 00:14:41	voni	the thing that actually made r/unixporn good at one point
2015-01-02 00:14:45	voni	was the fact that it's on reddit
2015-01-02 00:14:47	voni	and reddit is giant
2015-01-02 00:15:00	voni	so a new site would probably take quite a bit of time to gain popularity
